Abdul Hakim Shimul, a reporter for the Bangladeshi national daily Samakal newspaper, died on February 3, 2017, from gunshot wounds sustained while covering political unrest in the northern Bangladeshi city of Shahjadpur the previous day. He was 42.
Violence broke out between rival factions of the ruling Awami League, namely supporters of Halimul Haque Miru, mayor of Shahjadpur, and his opponents from another faction of the party, according to news reports. Witnesses said that Miru opened fire in the confrontation, despite police instructions not to do so, according to media reports. A bullet entered Shimul’s skull after piercing one of his eyes, according to news reports. Shimul was first treated at a local clinic, but succumbed to his injuries on the way to a hospital in the capital Dhaka the following day.
Police arrested Miru on February 5 on suspicion of being responsible for Shimul’s death. Miru admitted to firing his gun, but claimed he fired a shot in the air in response to shots fired by his rivals. Police said only Miru’s gun was fired, according to the Bangladeshi news website bdnews24.com.
A court on February 6 ordered Miru jailed in connection with Shimul’s death, and said it would decide on the question of bail later. Police sought to hold Miru for at least seven days for questioning, according to news reports.
According to media reports, Shimul’s maternal grandmother, Rokeya Begum, died of a stroke when she heard of his death. The journalist left behind a wife and two young children. His colleagues remembered Shimul as “honest journalist.”

2,Abdul Haq Baloch,ARY Television,"September 29, 2012",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"


Unidentified assailants shot Haq as he was leaving the Khuzdar
Press Club in the city of Khuzdar in Baluchistan province. Haq was the
secretary-general of the press club and a longtime local correspondent for ARY
Television. 
ARY Television said it was not aware of any threats directed
at Haq. But Hamid Mir, a prominent Pakistani journalist, wrote after Haq’s
death that the journalist had been threatened by the Baluch Musalah Diffa Army
(BMDA, or the Armed Baluch Defense) in November 2011 and had subsequently been
named on a hit list issued by a BMDA spokesman.
Tensions with the press had escalated after the Baluchistan
High Court barred news coverage of banned groups in October 2011. Several of
the banned groups began threatening local journalists for not reporting on
their militant operations.
Haq’s family declined to discuss widespread assertions by
his colleagues that he had been killed because security forces were angry that
he was working with the families of missing Baluchis on presenting cases before
the Quetta bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. At the time of Haq’s death,
the court was hearing more than 100 missing-person cases in Baluchistan. Of
those cases, 19 were from Khuzdar.

6,Achyutananda Sahu,Doordarshan,"October 30, 2018",India,Killed,Crossfire,,"
Video journalist Achyutananda Sahu, who worked for the government-run broadcaster Doordarshan, was killed in Chhattisgarh on October 30, 2018, during a firefight between police and a Maoist militant group, according to news reports.
At the time of the killing, the journalist and two colleagues from Doordarshan were embedded with the police and covering preparations for elections scheduled for the following month, the reports said. Sahu was on a motorcycle toward the front of the group when the clash, in which two police officers were also killed, took place, according to the Indian Express.
Chhattisgarh is one of four Indian states that have been the scene of a Maoist insurgency in the past few decades.
According to the police, the media team were caught in the crossfire when Maoists attacked the police. Accounts differed as to whether the attack was related to the upcoming election or a dispute over road construction.
Dheeraj Kumar, who was part of the Doordarshan news crew, told The Hindustan Times that the group was ambushed as it headed toward Nilwaya, about 5km (3 miles) from a paramilitary camp in Sameli, a village in the Dantewada district. ""I saw my colleague fall in front of me,"" Kumar said. ""We were planning to cover a newly-built polling station in Nilwaya where people haven’t voted since 1998.""
Special director general of police D.M. Awasthi told the media the attack was related to road construction. “Naxals warned about causing harm if the road construction work continued,” he said. Sahu and his team arrived to cover the road construction ahead of the polls when the attack took place, according to Awasthi.

The Communist Party of India (Maoist) released a statement taking responsibility for Sahu’s death, according to the Press Trust of India. “It is sad that camera person Achyutananda Sahu was killed in the attack. We had no intention to target media personnel,” Sainath, the secretary of the Dharba division of CPI (Maoist) said in the statement. He also advised journalists not to embed with police when in conflict zones.
In response to the killing, Rajyavardhan Rathore, who heads the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that has responsibility for the station, tweeted, ""Stand in solidarity with family of the cameraman, we will take care of his family. We salute all those media persons who go for coverage in such dangerous situations, remember their bravery."" 
According to NDTV, he ordered compensation of 15,00,000 Indian rupees (US$21,000) to be paid to the journalist’s family.

7,Ahmed Rajib Haider,Freelance,"February 15, 2013",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Haider, a blogger also known as “Thaba Baba,” was killed by assailants wielding machetes outside his home in the Pallabi neighborhood in the capital, Dhaka.
Haider, who also worked as an architect, had written critically on his blog and social networking sites about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups, and had covered mass nationwide demonstrations, called the “Shahbagh movement,” in which protesters called for the death penalty for leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami party who were on trial for war crimes.
Haider’s brother said he had been targeted by the Islami Chhatra Shibir–the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party–for his “online activities,” reports said. News reports said activists of the Shahbagh movement also blamed members of the Islami Chhatra Shibir for the blogger’s death. The student wing has been involved in sporadic street attacks since the protests began, according to reports.
Members of the Jamaat-e-Islami party denied the accusations, reports said.
News reports also cited Haider’s relatives and friends as saying the blogger was killed for the posts he wrote urging that the alleged war criminals be brought to justice. News reports citing another Bangladeshi blogger, Shakil Ahmed, said that a pro-Jamaat website had named Haider as a target the week before his death.
News accounts reported that Haider also used his Facebook page to publicize the protests and encourage demonstrators to attend them. The day before his death, the blogger had participated in the protests, reports said. On February 11, 2013, a blog, called Sonarbangla, which is run by members of the Jamaat-e-Islami party and its student wing, published a story calling Haider one of the main organizers of the protests, news reports said.
Police arrested five individuals who confessed to the murder and said they had received an order from an Islami Chhatra Shibir leader to kill Haider, and that it was their religious obligation to do so, reports said. Police told the media that the plot to kill the blogger had been formed several months prior in connection with Haider’s Facebook posts that criticized Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups.
On December 31, 2015, a Dhaka court convicted and sentenced two students to death for Haider’s murder, including Rezwanul Azad Rana, a fugitive who was charged in absentia and who was described by police as the mastermind, according to news reports. Six others were convicted in the attack, according to The Associated Press. The court sentenced Jashim Uddin Rahmani, the leader of banned Islamist group Ansarullah Bangla Team, to five years in jail for “abetting murder” by inciting students to kill secular bloggers; one student was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder; and four others were jailed for three years on lesser charges, according to news reports. A lawyer for the defendants said they would appeal, reports said.
CPJ research showed an escalation in attacks against online journalists in Bangladesh since the beginning of 2013. In early April, authorities arrested four journalists, one of whom had been stabbed a few months prior.
Haider’s funeral procession was attended by tens of thousands. He is survived by his wife.

Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla, a blogger and reporter for independent news website Minivan News, was killed by a local Al-Qaeda affiliate in the Maldives on August 8, 2014, Husnu Al Suood, the head of the presidential commission on enforced disappearances and murders, said on September 1, 2019, according to Al-Jazeera. Rilwan was last seen on August 7, 2014, according to news reports and CPJ reporting, and had been considered missing for five years. 
Rilwan was forced into a car outside of his home at knifepoint in the early hours of August 8, 2014, according to the same reports. Al Suuod said he was then taken to a boat out at sea, where he was killed, according to Al-Jazeera. 
Al Suood said that Rilwan had been killed for his writing about alleged Al-Qaeda links in the Maldives and his advocacy for freedom of expression, according to news reports.
The commission identified several individuals suspected of involvement in Rilwan’s abduction and killing, and subsequent government interference in the case, according to a report by Rilwan’s employer, which has since changed its name to The Maldives Independent. 
The commission asked the prosecutor general’s office to appeal the 2018 acquittals of two suspects charged over Rilwan’s abduction, given the new evidence, according to the Independent.
Al Suood also recommended obstruction of justice charges be filed against former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb for allegedly intervening to release two suspects allegedly involved in Rilwan’s disappearance, and also said the commission found evidence that former President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom tried to “divert the focus of the police investigation,” but added that there was not enough evidence to recommend charges, the Independent reported.
Yameen’s lawyer dismissed allegations of undue interference, and Adeeb has previously denied any involvement in Rilwan’s case, according to Al-Jazeera.
The prosecutor general’s office in the Maldives did not immediately respond to CPJ’s request for comment via messaging app.

Nadesan, a veteran Tamil journalist with the national Tamil-language
daily Virakesari, was shot by unidentified assailants in Batticaloa,
a town on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka about 135 miles (216 kilometers)
from the capital, Colombo, according to international news reports
and local journalists.
Nadesan, who had worked at Virakesari for 20 years, was on
his way to work when he was ambushed near a Hindu temple. The assailants
escaped, and no group claimed responsibility.
Nadesan was an award-winning journalist who used the pen name Nellai
G. Nadesan. He also reported for the International Broadcast Group,
a Tamil-language radio station that broadcasts from London. 
Violence erupted in Sri Lanka’s eastern region in the weeks before
the murder after the main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), launched a military offensive against a breakaway
faction headed by a soldier known as Colonel Karuna. Local journalists
said that Nadesan was sympathetic to the LTTE. The LTTE accused the
Sri Lankan army and members of the breakaway faction of Nadesan’s
murder, according to the pro-LTTE Internet news site Tamil.net.
Nadesan had been harassed and threatened before his death because
he had criticized the government and security forces, according to
CPJ research. On June 17, 2001, a Sri Lankan army officer summoned
Nadesan for an interrogation and threatened the journalist with arrest
unless he ceased reporting about the army.

Four unidentified assailants wielding cleavers and machetes hacked Ananta Bijoy Das to death on a busy street as the blogger was heading to work in the city of Sylhet, according to news reports. Kamrul Hasan, commissioner of Sylhet police, told local journalists that the four assailants fled the scene.
Das had contributed to the blog Mukto Mona–the blog founded by Bangladeshi blogger Avijit Roy, who was killed in early 2015–and was also the editor of a quarterly scientific magazine named Jukti (Reason), the reports said. He had also written numerous books, one on evolution. Das, who worked for a bank as his day job, had mainly written on science. He had also been critical of religious fundamentalism and previous attacks on secular thinkers in his writing, CNN reported.
According to news reports which cited Imran Sarker, head of an organization of secular bloggers, Das was also an activist during the 2013 Shahbag movement, which called for the death penalty for leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami party who were on trial for war crimes.
The day before he was killed, Das wrote a post on Facebook in which he criticized police for their handling of the investigation into the murders of Bangladeshi bloggers Roy and Washiqur Rahman Babu, according to The Associated Press.
Das’s murder came just weeks after the attack on Babu, who was hacked to death in the street on March 30, 2015. In February 2015, Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka, according to news reports. Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured.
In early May 2015, an Al-Qaeda branch claimed responsibility for the attack on Roy and his wife as well as for the 2013 murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in a video posted online, according to reports. The video also urged followers to carry out other such attacks against “blasphemers.”
Debasish Debu, a friend of Das, told journalists that the blogger had received threats for his writing and that the frequency of threats increased after the attack on Roy.
Police said they were investigating the murder, but no immediate arrests were made, news reports said. On May 13, 2015, The New York Times reported that Islamist extremists claimed responsibility for Das’s murder.

Unidentified gunmen shot dead Mazumdar, the editor of an Assamese language daily Aji, as he was returning from his office outside his home in Rajgarh. His driver, Ramen Nath, and neighbors rushed him to a hospital, where Mazumdar was declared dead, according to the Telegraph.
Mazumdar had been supportive of peace talks between the separatist guerrilla group, United Liberation Front of Asom, which operates in the state, and the government, the Telegraph reported. The paper had taken a stand of supporting negotiations between the government and the militant group, Agence France Presse reported.

The same evening that Mazumdar was killed, suspected militants shot dead a leader with the liberation front who was supportive of peace talks, according to reports.

“[Mazumdar] was known for his bold and fearless journalism,” Atanu Bhuyan, a fellow journalist, was quoted as saying in news reports. His killing came days after security officials warned journalists in the area that rebel groups could target some of them before an upcoming general election, Reuters reported.

Three years after his death, the Gauhati High Court ordered that the Central Bureau of Investigation take over the case, after his widow, Mallika Kalita Majumdar, petitioned the court that she was dissatisfied with the investigation by Assam police, reports said.

In January 2016, the CBI filed a closure report naming Bijoy Phukan, a deceased United Liberation Front of Asom militant, as his killer. According to the report, a fortnight after Mazumdar’s killing, Phukan’s body was found with bullet injuries on the bank of the Brahmaputra river in Nalbari district. CPJ was unable to determine if Mazumdar’s family accepted the judgment.

22,Abdul Haq Baloch,ARY Television,"September 29, 2012",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"


Unidentified assailants shot Haq as he was leaving the Khuzdar
Press Club in the city of Khuzdar in Baluchistan province. Haq was the
secretary-general of the press club and a longtime local correspondent for ARY
Television. 
ARY Television said it was not aware of any threats directed
at Haq. But Hamid Mir, a prominent Pakistani journalist, wrote after Haq’s
death that the journalist had been threatened by the Baluch Musalah Diffa Army
(BMDA, or the Armed Baluch Defense) in November 2011 and had subsequently been
named on a hit list issued by a BMDA spokesman.
Tensions with the press had escalated after the Baluchistan
High Court barred news coverage of banned groups in October 2011. Several of
the banned groups began threatening local journalists for not reporting on
their militant operations.
Haq’s family declined to discuss widespread assertions by
his colleagues that he had been killed because security forces were angry that
he was working with the families of missing Baluchis on presenting cases before
the Quetta bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. At the time of Haq’s death,
the court was hearing more than 100 missing-person cases in Baluchistan. Of
those cases, 19 were from Khuzdar.

26,Achyutananda Sahu,Doordarshan,"October 30, 2018",India,Killed,Crossfire,,"
Video journalist Achyutananda Sahu, who worked for the government-run broadcaster Doordarshan, was killed in Chhattisgarh on October 30, 2018, during a firefight between police and a Maoist militant group, according to news reports.
At the time of the killing, the journalist and two colleagues from Doordarshan were embedded with the police and covering preparations for elections scheduled for the following month, the reports said. Sahu was on a motorcycle toward the front of the group when the clash, in which two police officers were also killed, took place, according to the Indian Express.
Chhattisgarh is one of four Indian states that have been the scene of a Maoist insurgency in the past few decades.
According to the police, the media team were caught in the crossfire when Maoists attacked the police. Accounts differed as to whether the attack was related to the upcoming election or a dispute over road construction.
Dheeraj Kumar, who was part of the Doordarshan news crew, told The Hindustan Times that the group was ambushed as it headed toward Nilwaya, about 5km (3 miles) from a paramilitary camp in Sameli, a village in the Dantewada district. ""I saw my colleague fall in front of me,"" Kumar said. ""We were planning to cover a newly-built polling station in Nilwaya where people haven’t voted since 1998.""
Special director general of police D.M. Awasthi told the media the attack was related to road construction. “Naxals warned about causing harm if the road construction work continued,” he said. Sahu and his team arrived to cover the road construction ahead of the polls when the attack took place, according to Awasthi.

The Communist Party of India (Maoist) released a statement taking responsibility for Sahu’s death, according to the Press Trust of India. “It is sad that camera person Achyutananda Sahu was killed in the attack. We had no intention to target media personnel,” Sainath, the secretary of the Dharba division of CPI (Maoist) said in the statement. He also advised journalists not to embed with police when in conflict zones.
In response to the killing, Rajyavardhan Rathore, who heads the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that has responsibility for the station, tweeted, ""Stand in solidarity with family of the cameraman, we will take care of his family. We salute all those media persons who go for coverage in such dangerous situations, remember their bravery."" 
According to NDTV, he ordered compensation of 15,00,000 Indian rupees (US$21,000) to be paid to the journalist’s family.

27,Ahmed Rajib Haider,Freelance,"February 15, 2013",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Haider, a blogger also known as “Thaba Baba,” was killed by assailants wielding machetes outside his home in the Pallabi neighborhood in the capital, Dhaka.
Haider, who also worked as an architect, had written critically on his blog and social networking sites about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups, and had covered mass nationwide demonstrations, called the “Shahbagh movement,” in which protesters called for the death penalty for leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami party who were on trial for war crimes.
Haider’s brother said he had been targeted by the Islami Chhatra Shibir–the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party–for his “online activities,” reports said. News reports said activists of the Shahbagh movement also blamed members of the Islami Chhatra Shibir for the blogger’s death. The student wing has been involved in sporadic street attacks since the protests began, according to reports.
Members of the Jamaat-e-Islami party denied the accusations, reports said.
News reports also cited Haider’s relatives and friends as saying the blogger was killed for the posts he wrote urging that the alleged war criminals be brought to justice. News reports citing another Bangladeshi blogger, Shakil Ahmed, said that a pro-Jamaat website had named Haider as a target the week before his death.
News accounts reported that Haider also used his Facebook page to publicize the protests and encourage demonstrators to attend them. The day before his death, the blogger had participated in the protests, reports said. On February 11, 2013, a blog, called Sonarbangla, which is run by members of the Jamaat-e-Islami party and its student wing, published a story calling Haider one of the main organizers of the protests, news reports said.
Police arrested five individuals who confessed to the murder and said they had received an order from an Islami Chhatra Shibir leader to kill Haider, and that it was their religious obligation to do so, reports said. Police told the media that the plot to kill the blogger had been formed several months prior in connection with Haider’s Facebook posts that criticized Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups.
On December 31, 2015, a Dhaka court convicted and sentenced two students to death for Haider’s murder, including Rezwanul Azad Rana, a fugitive who was charged in absentia and who was described by police as the mastermind, according to news reports. Six others were convicted in the attack, according to The Associated Press. The court sentenced Jashim Uddin Rahmani, the leader of banned Islamist group Ansarullah Bangla Team, to five years in jail for “abetting murder” by inciting students to kill secular bloggers; one student was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder; and four others were jailed for three years on lesser charges, according to news reports. A lawyer for the defendants said they would appeal, reports said.
CPJ research showed an escalation in attacks against online journalists in Bangladesh since the beginning of 2013. In early April, authorities arrested four journalists, one of whom had been stabbed a few months prior.
Haider’s funeral procession was attended by tens of thousands. He is survived by his wife.

Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla, a blogger and reporter for independent news website Minivan News, was killed by a local Al-Qaeda affiliate in the Maldives on August 8, 2014, Husnu Al Suood, the head of the presidential commission on enforced disappearances and murders, said on September 1, 2019, according to Al-Jazeera. Rilwan was last seen on August 7, 2014, according to news reports and CPJ reporting, and had been considered missing for five years. 
Rilwan was forced into a car outside of his home at knifepoint in the early hours of August 8, 2014, according to the same reports. Al Suuod said he was then taken to a boat out at sea, where he was killed, according to Al-Jazeera. 
Al Suood said that Rilwan had been killed for his writing about alleged Al-Qaeda links in the Maldives and his advocacy for freedom of expression, according to news reports.
The commission identified several individuals suspected of involvement in Rilwan’s abduction and killing, and subsequent government interference in the case, according to a report by Rilwan’s employer, which has since changed its name to The Maldives Independent. 
The commission asked the prosecutor general’s office to appeal the 2018 acquittals of two suspects charged over Rilwan’s abduction, given the new evidence, according to the Independent.
Al Suood also recommended obstruction of justice charges be filed against former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb for allegedly intervening to release two suspects allegedly involved in Rilwan’s disappearance, and also said the commission found evidence that former President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom tried to “divert the focus of the police investigation,” but added that there was not enough evidence to recommend charges, the Independent reported.
Yameen’s lawyer dismissed allegations of undue interference, and Adeeb has previously denied any involvement in Rilwan’s case, according to Al-Jazeera.
The prosecutor general’s office in the Maldives did not immediately respond to CPJ’s request for comment via messaging app.

Nadesan, a veteran Tamil journalist with the national Tamil-language
daily Virakesari, was shot by unidentified assailants in Batticaloa,
a town on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka about 135 miles (216 kilometers)
from the capital, Colombo, according to international news reports
and local journalists.
Nadesan, who had worked at Virakesari for 20 years, was on
his way to work when he was ambushed near a Hindu temple. The assailants
escaped, and no group claimed responsibility.
Nadesan was an award-winning journalist who used the pen name Nellai
G. Nadesan. He also reported for the International Broadcast Group,
a Tamil-language radio station that broadcasts from London. 
Violence erupted in Sri Lanka’s eastern region in the weeks before
the murder after the main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), launched a military offensive against a breakaway
faction headed by a soldier known as Colonel Karuna. Local journalists
said that Nadesan was sympathetic to the LTTE. The LTTE accused the
Sri Lankan army and members of the breakaway faction of Nadesan’s
murder, according to the pro-LTTE Internet news site Tamil.net.
Nadesan had been harassed and threatened before his death because
he had criticized the government and security forces, according to
CPJ research. On June 17, 2001, a Sri Lankan army officer summoned
Nadesan for an interrogation and threatened the journalist with arrest
unless he ceased reporting about the army.

Four unidentified assailants wielding cleavers and machetes hacked Ananta Bijoy Das to death on a busy street as the blogger was heading to work in the city of Sylhet, according to news reports. Kamrul Hasan, commissioner of Sylhet police, told local journalists that the four assailants fled the scene.
Das had contributed to the blog Mukto Mona–the blog founded by Bangladeshi blogger Avijit Roy, who was killed in early 2015–and was also the editor of a quarterly scientific magazine named Jukti (Reason), the reports said. He had also written numerous books, one on evolution. Das, who worked for a bank as his day job, had mainly written on science. He had also been critical of religious fundamentalism and previous attacks on secular thinkers in his writing, CNN reported.
According to news reports which cited Imran Sarker, head of an organization of secular bloggers, Das was also an activist during the 2013 Shahbag movement, which called for the death penalty for leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami party who were on trial for war crimes.
The day before he was killed, Das wrote a post on Facebook in which he criticized police for their handling of the investigation into the murders of Bangladeshi bloggers Roy and Washiqur Rahman Babu, according to The Associated Press.
Das’s murder came just weeks after the attack on Babu, who was hacked to death in the street on March 30, 2015. In February 2015, Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka, according to news reports. Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured.
In early May 2015, an Al-Qaeda branch claimed responsibility for the attack on Roy and his wife as well as for the 2013 murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in a video posted online, according to reports. The video also urged followers to carry out other such attacks against “blasphemers.”
Debasish Debu, a friend of Das, told journalists that the blogger had received threats for his writing and that the frequency of threats increased after the attack on Roy.
Police said they were investigating the murder, but no immediate arrests were made, news reports said. On May 13, 2015, The New York Times reported that Islamist extremists claimed responsibility for Das’s murder.

Unidentified gunmen shot dead Mazumdar, the editor of an Assamese language daily Aji, as he was returning from his office outside his home in Rajgarh. His driver, Ramen Nath, and neighbors rushed him to a hospital, where Mazumdar was declared dead, according to the Telegraph.
Mazumdar had been supportive of peace talks between the separatist guerrilla group, United Liberation Front of Asom, which operates in the state, and the government, the Telegraph reported. The paper had taken a stand of supporting negotiations between the government and the militant group, Agence France Presse reported.

The same evening that Mazumdar was killed, suspected militants shot dead a leader with the liberation front who was supportive of peace talks, according to reports.

“[Mazumdar] was known for his bold and fearless journalism,” Atanu Bhuyan, a fellow journalist, was quoted as saying in news reports. His killing came days after security officials warned journalists in the area that rebel groups could target some of them before an upcoming general election, Reuters reported.

Three years after his death, the Gauhati High Court ordered that the Central Bureau of Investigation take over the case, after his widow, Mallika Kalita Majumdar, petitioned the court that she was dissatisfied with the investigation by Assam police, reports said.

In January 2016, the CBI filed a closure report naming Bijoy Phukan, a deceased United Liberation Front of Asom militant, as his killer. According to the report, a fortnight after Mazumdar’s killing, Phukan’s body was found with bullet injuries on the bank of the Brahmaputra river in Nalbari district. CPJ was unable to determine if Mazumdar’s family accepted the judgment.

46,Achyutananda Sahu,Doordarshan,"October 30, 2018",India,Killed,Crossfire,,"
Video journalist Achyutananda Sahu, who worked for the government-run broadcaster Doordarshan, was killed in Chhattisgarh on October 30, 2018, during a firefight between police and a Maoist militant group, according to news reports.
At the time of the killing, the journalist and two colleagues from Doordarshan were embedded with the police and covering preparations for elections scheduled for the following month, the reports said. Sahu was on a motorcycle toward the front of the group when the clash, in which two police officers were also killed, took place, according to the Indian Express.
Chhattisgarh is one of four Indian states that have been the scene of a Maoist insurgency in the past few decades.
According to the police, the media team were caught in the crossfire when Maoists attacked the police. Accounts differed as to whether the attack was related to the upcoming election or a dispute over road construction.
Dheeraj Kumar, who was part of the Doordarshan news crew, told The Hindustan Times that the group was ambushed as it headed toward Nilwaya, about 5km (3 miles) from a paramilitary camp in Sameli, a village in the Dantewada district. ""I saw my colleague fall in front of me,"" Kumar said. ""We were planning to cover a newly-built polling station in Nilwaya where people haven’t voted since 1998.""
Special director general of police D.M. Awasthi told the media the attack was related to road construction. “Naxals warned about causing harm if the road construction work continued,” he said. Sahu and his team arrived to cover the road construction ahead of the polls when the attack took place, according to Awasthi.

The Communist Party of India (Maoist) released a statement taking responsibility for Sahu’s death, according to the Press Trust of India. “It is sad that camera person Achyutananda Sahu was killed in the attack. We had no intention to target media personnel,” Sainath, the secretary of the Dharba division of CPI (Maoist) said in the statement. He also advised journalists not to embed with police when in conflict zones.
In response to the killing, Rajyavardhan Rathore, who heads the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that has responsibility for the station, tweeted, ""Stand in solidarity with family of the cameraman, we will take care of his family. We salute all those media persons who go for coverage in such dangerous situations, remember their bravery."" 
According to NDTV, he ordered compensation of 15,00,000 Indian rupees (US$21,000) to be paid to the journalist’s family.

47,Ahmed Rajib Haider,Freelance,"February 15, 2013",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Haider, a blogger also known as “Thaba Baba,” was killed by assailants wielding machetes outside his home in the Pallabi neighborhood in the capital, Dhaka.
Haider, who also worked as an architect, had written critically on his blog and social networking sites about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups, and had covered mass nationwide demonstrations, called the “Shahbagh movement,” in which protesters called for the death penalty for leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami party who were on trial for war crimes.
Haider’s brother said he had been targeted by the Islami Chhatra Shibir–the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party–for his “online activities,” reports said. News reports said activists of the Shahbagh movement also blamed members of the Islami Chhatra Shibir for the blogger’s death. The student wing has been involved in sporadic street attacks since the protests began, according to reports.
Members of the Jamaat-e-Islami party denied the accusations, reports said.
News reports also cited Haider’s relatives and friends as saying the blogger was killed for the posts he wrote urging that the alleged war criminals be brought to justice. News reports citing another Bangladeshi blogger, Shakil Ahmed, said that a pro-Jamaat website had named Haider as a target the week before his death.
News accounts reported that Haider also used his Facebook page to publicize the protests and encourage demonstrators to attend them. The day before his death, the blogger had participated in the protests, reports said. On February 11, 2013, a blog, called Sonarbangla, which is run by members of the Jamaat-e-Islami party and its student wing, published a story calling Haider one of the main organizers of the protests, news reports said.
Police arrested five individuals who confessed to the murder and said they had received an order from an Islami Chhatra Shibir leader to kill Haider, and that it was their religious obligation to do so, reports said. Police told the media that the plot to kill the blogger had been formed several months prior in connection with Haider’s Facebook posts that criticized Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups.
On December 31, 2015, a Dhaka court convicted and sentenced two students to death for Haider’s murder, including Rezwanul Azad Rana, a fugitive who was charged in absentia and who was described by police as the mastermind, according to news reports. Six others were convicted in the attack, according to The Associated Press. The court sentenced Jashim Uddin Rahmani, the leader of banned Islamist group Ansarullah Bangla Team, to five years in jail for “abetting murder” by inciting students to kill secular bloggers; one student was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder; and four others were jailed for three years on lesser charges, according to news reports. A lawyer for the defendants said they would appeal, reports said.
CPJ research showed an escalation in attacks against online journalists in Bangladesh since the beginning of 2013. In early April, authorities arrested four journalists, one of whom had been stabbed a few months prior.
Haider’s funeral procession was attended by tens of thousands. He is survived by his wife.

48,Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla,Minivan News,"August 8, 2014",Maldives,Killed,Murder,,"
Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla, a blogger and reporter for independent news website Minivan News, was killed by a local Al-Qaeda affiliate in the Maldives on August 8, 2014, Husnu Al Suood, the head of the presidential commission on enforced disappearances and murders, said on September 1, 2019, according to Al-Jazeera. Rilwan was last seen on August 7, 2014, according to news reports and CPJ reporting, and had been considered missing for five years. 
Rilwan was forced into a car outside of his home at knifepoint in the early hours of August 8, 2014, according to the same reports. Al Suuod said he was then taken to a boat out at sea, where he was killed, according to Al-Jazeera. 
Al Suood said that Rilwan had been killed for his writing about alleged Al-Qaeda links in the Maldives and his advocacy for freedom of expression, according to news reports.
The commission identified several individuals suspected of involvement in Rilwan’s abduction and killing, and subsequent government interference in the case, according to a report by Rilwan’s employer, which has since changed its name to The Maldives Independent. 
The commission asked the prosecutor general’s office to appeal the 2018 acquittals of two suspects charged over Rilwan’s abduction, given the new evidence, according to the Independent.
Al Suood also recommended obstruction of justice charges be filed against former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb for allegedly intervening to release two suspects allegedly involved in Rilwan’s disappearance, and also said the commission found evidence that former President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom tried to “divert the focus of the police investigation,” but added that there was not enough evidence to recommend charges, the Independent reported.
Yameen’s lawyer dismissed allegations of undue interference, and Adeeb has previously denied any involvement in Rilwan’s case, according to Al-Jazeera.
The prosecutor general’s office in the Maldives did not immediately respond to CPJ’s request for comment via messaging app.

Nadesan, a veteran Tamil journalist with the national Tamil-language
daily Virakesari, was shot by unidentified assailants in Batticaloa,
a town on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka about 135 miles (216 kilometers)
from the capital, Colombo, according to international news reports
and local journalists.
Nadesan, who had worked at Virakesari for 20 years, was on
his way to work when he was ambushed near a Hindu temple. The assailants
escaped, and no group claimed responsibility.
Nadesan was an award-winning journalist who used the pen name Nellai
G. Nadesan. He also reported for the International Broadcast Group,
a Tamil-language radio station that broadcasts from London. 
Violence erupted in Sri Lanka’s eastern region in the weeks before
the murder after the main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), launched a military offensive against a breakaway
faction headed by a soldier known as Colonel Karuna. Local journalists
said that Nadesan was sympathetic to the LTTE. The LTTE accused the
Sri Lankan army and members of the breakaway faction of Nadesan’s
murder, according to the pro-LTTE Internet news site Tamil.net.
Nadesan had been harassed and threatened before his death because
he had criticized the government and security forces, according to
CPJ research. On June 17, 2001, a Sri Lankan army officer summoned
Nadesan for an interrogation and threatened the journalist with arrest
unless he ceased reporting about the army.

53,Ananta Bijoy Das,Freelance,"May 12, 2015",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Four unidentified assailants wielding cleavers and machetes hacked Ananta Bijoy Das to death on a busy street as the blogger was heading to work in the city of Sylhet, according to news reports. Kamrul Hasan, commissioner of Sylhet police, told local journalists that the four assailants fled the scene.
Das had contributed to the blog Mukto Mona–the blog founded by Bangladeshi blogger Avijit Roy, who was killed in early 2015–and was also the editor of a quarterly scientific magazine named Jukti (Reason), the reports said. He had also written numerous books, one on evolution. Das, who worked for a bank as his day job, had mainly written on science. He had also been critical of religious fundamentalism and previous attacks on secular thinkers in his writing, CNN reported.
According to news reports which cited Imran Sarker, head of an organization of secular bloggers, Das was also an activist during the 2013 Shahbag movement, which called for the death penalty for leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami party who were on trial for war crimes.
The day before he was killed, Das wrote a post on Facebook in which he criticized police for their handling of the investigation into the murders of Bangladeshi bloggers Roy and Washiqur Rahman Babu, according to The Associated Press.
Das’s murder came just weeks after the attack on Babu, who was hacked to death in the street on March 30, 2015. In February 2015, Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka, according to news reports. Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured.
In early May 2015, an Al-Qaeda branch claimed responsibility for the attack on Roy and his wife as well as for the 2013 murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in a video posted online, according to reports. The video also urged followers to carry out other such attacks against “blasphemers.”
Debasish Debu, a friend of Das, told journalists that the blogger had received threats for his writing and that the frequency of threats increased after the attack on Roy.
Police said they were investigating the murder, but no immediate arrests were made, news reports said. On May 13, 2015, The New York Times reported that Islamist extremists claimed responsibility for Das’s murder.

Unidentified gunmen shot dead Mazumdar, the editor of an Assamese language daily Aji, as he was returning from his office outside his home in Rajgarh. His driver, Ramen Nath, and neighbors rushed him to a hospital, where Mazumdar was declared dead, according to the Telegraph.
Mazumdar had been supportive of peace talks between the separatist guerrilla group, United Liberation Front of Asom, which operates in the state, and the government, the Telegraph reported. The paper had taken a stand of supporting negotiations between the government and the militant group, Agence France Presse reported.

The same evening that Mazumdar was killed, suspected militants shot dead a leader with the liberation front who was supportive of peace talks, according to reports.

“[Mazumdar] was known for his bold and fearless journalism,” Atanu Bhuyan, a fellow journalist, was quoted as saying in news reports. His killing came days after security officials warned journalists in the area that rebel groups could target some of them before an upcoming general election, Reuters reported.

Three years after his death, the Gauhati High Court ordered that the Central Bureau of Investigation take over the case, after his widow, Mallika Kalita Majumdar, petitioned the court that she was dissatisfied with the investigation by Assam police, reports said.

In January 2016, the CBI filed a closure report naming Bijoy Phukan, a deceased United Liberation Front of Asom militant, as his killer. According to the report, a fortnight after Mazumdar’s killing, Phukan’s body was found with bullet injuries on the bank of the Brahmaputra river in Nalbari district. CPJ was unable to determine if Mazumdar’s family accepted the judgment.

The assailants stabbed and hacked at them with sharp weapons and fled the scene, news reports said. Roy and Bonna were taken to a local hospital, where Roy was pronounced dead, according to news reports. Bonna was critically wounded.
Roy, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was visiting Bangladesh to attend the book fair, news accounts said. The blogger had covered secular issues including science, homosexuality, atheism, and free expression on his blog, Mukto-Mona (Free Mind), and had published several books on those issues, news reports said. Roy, a Hindu, was critical of religious fundamentalism in his writings on Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim country.
The blogger had reported receiving death threats from Islamists to his friends and family and to the U.K.-based human rights organization the International Humanist and Ethical Union, the organization said. The blogger’s father told journalists that Roy had received threatening messages over email and on social media from individuals who were unhappy with his writing, news reports said.
Police said they suspected Islamist radicals were involved in the murder, according to news reports. In 2013, Islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy, according to news reports.
The killing attracted international attention. Agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrived about a week after Roy’s murder to assist local police in the investigation, according to news reports. On March 2, 2015 Bangladeshi authorities arrested Shafiur Rahman Farabi, a 29-year-old student and a Muslim blogger who had often preached radicalism, according to news reports.
On February 16, 2021, a Bangladesh court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in Roy’s killing, and another to life in prison, according to news reports.
The court sentenced Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque, Akram Hossain, Abu Siddique Sohel, Mozammel Hossain, and Arafat Rahman to death by hanging, and Shafiur Rahman Farabi to life imprisonment, according to those reports. The six defendants were all members of the banned militant outfit Ansar al-Islam, and killed Roy for being a “secular writer,” according to those reports.

Eyewitness accounts said two unidentified assailants riding a motorcycle waited outside Khattak’s home, fired at him when he appeared, and then fled the scene, the reports said.
Khattak’s colleagues said he had recently published a story on the sale of illegal drugs and a local gang of drug peddlers, according to news reports. Khattak had worked as a journalist since 2004, and had received threats in the past after his reports exposed criminal elements in the region.
Khattak’s family said they believed Khattak had been targeted in relation to his work. The journalist’s son filed a First Information Report with the police, in which he named two individuals as drug dealers, claiming they were responsible for his father’s murder, according to the Freedom Network.
The murder came only days after Minister of Information Pervaiz Rasheed expressed his support for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate attacks against journalists as part of the implementation of the larger U.N. Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issue of Impunity at a meeting in Islamabad on October 8.

During the trial, the court was told Khattak’s reporting on drug dealing angered Aminullah Niaz, and that he had previously threatened the journalist.

Maoist leaders sought to distance themselves from the slaying, which they called an anarchic act orchestrated by a district committee member, Lal Bahadur Chaudhary. Shah, local correspondent for Nepal FM, Dristi Weekly, and Avenues TV, had been critical of local Maoists in his reports.
His body was recovered by police in a forested area 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Kathmandu on November 8, according to The Associated Press. A funeral held the next day attracted more than 3,000 mourners. Some of the crowd attempted to set fire to the house of one of the accused killers, the Voice of America reported.
On May 30, 2011, a judge in central Bara district sentenced two defendants, Mainejar Giri and Ram Ekwal Sahini, to life
terms and confiscated their property on charges of carrying out the
abduction and murder, according to local news reports. Lal Bahadur
Chaudhary had not been detained.

67,Chandan Tiwari,Aj Newspaper,"October 30, 2018",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Chandan Tiwari, a local reporter with Hindi daily Aj in Jharkhand’s Chatra district, was abducted and badly beaten on October 29, 2018. Police said the reporter was found injured in a forest about 175 miles from Pathalgada, in Jharkhand.  He succumbed to his injuries the next day, according to NDTV. 
Jharkhand police identified four people–Maoist area commander Prasant, Pintu Singh, Jamuna Prasad, and Musafir Rana–as suspects who abducted and killed the journalist. Police arrested Prasant, Prasad, and Rana, but Singh remained free as of December 2018. The First Information Report filed by the police–which has been reviewed by CPJ–names all four suspects. 
Local reporters told CPJ that Maoists run a criminal network in the area, and that Singh is part of this network.
According to a report in Dainik Bhaskar, police claim that Singh targeted Tiwari for alleging financial irregularities in Singh’s role as a private contractor for a government-funded program to support rural employment. On April 2, 2018, Tiwari published a story about Singh’s alleged corruption; and also posted about it on his Facebook page. Chatra police superintendent Akhilesh B. Variar told Dainik Bhaskar that Singh plotted against Tiwari because of the financial loss he incurred from Tiwari’s reporting. 
Tiwari’s editor, Amit Kumar Agrawal, told CPJ that the slain reporter had filed a complaint on April 6, 2018, with the police about a possible threat to his life. A copy of the complaint is available on Tiwari’s Facebook page. Agrawal also told NDTV that police did not act on the complaint. 
As of late 2018, police had not filed a charge sheet in the case. When reached by phone by CPJ for comment on the case, Variar asked to be contacted by email. As of late 2018, Variar had not responded to questions via email.

70,Daniel Pearl,The Wall Street Journal,"Between January 23 and February 21, 2002",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
U.S. government officials confirmed on February 21, 2002, that Pearl, kidnapped South Asia correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, had been killed by his captors.
 The exact date of his murder was uncertain, but authorities announced his death after receiving a graphic, three-and-a-half minute digital videotape containing scenes in which one of the killers slits Pearl’s throat, and then someone holds his severed head. The faces of the assailants are not visible on the video. This, and other details below, are documented in an extensive report on Pearl’s murder, entitled The Truth Left Behind: Inside the Kidnapping and Murder of Daniel Pearl, published in 2011 by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and The Center for Public Integrity.
 Pearl, 38, went missing on January 23, 2002, in the port city of Karachi, Pakistan, and was last seen on his way to an interview at the Village Restaurant, downtown near the Metropole Hotel. According to The Wall Street Journal, Pearl had been reporting on Richard Reid, a suspected terrorist who allegedly tried to blow up an airplane during a transatlantic flight with a bomb in his shoe.
 Four days after his disappearance, a group calling itself ""The National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty"" sent an e-mail to several U.S.- and Pakistan-based news organizations claiming responsibility for kidnapping Pearl and accusing him of being an American spy. The e-mail also contained four photographs of the journalist, including one in which he is held at gunpoint and another in which he is holding a copy of the January 24 issue of Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper.
 The e-mail contained a series of demands, including the repatriation of Pakistani detainees held by the U.S. Army in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The sender or senders, who used a Hotmail e-mail account under the name ""Kidnapperguy,"" said Pearl was ""at present being kept in very inhuman circumstances quite similar infact [sic] to the way that Pakistanis and nationals of other sovereign countries are being kept in Cuba by the American Army.""
 Another e-mail was sent on January 30, also including photographs of Pearl held captive. This e-mail accused him of being an agent of Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, and said he would be killed within 24 hours unless the group’s demands were met.
 After scrutinizing the videotape that officials received weeks later, authorities believe that Pearl may have been murdered before the second e-mail was sent. During that footage, Pearl is forced to identify himself as Jewish and to deliver scripted lines reiterating some of the demands made in the e-mails, according to an FBI analysis of the tape that was provided to the Journal.
 On February 12, 2002, before Pearl’s murder was discovered, Pakistani police announced the arrest of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, whom they identified as the prime suspect behind the journalist’s kidnapping.
 On March 14, a U.S. grand jury indicted Saeed, charging him with hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking resulting in Pearl’s murder. U.S. prosecutors also unsealed a secret indictment filed against Saeed in November 2001 accusing him of participating in the 1994 kidnapping of U.S. tourist Bela Nuss in India. Pakistan refused to extradite Saeed, possibly to avoid damaging disclosures of links between the country’s intelligence agencies and militant Islamist groups that the United States wants to see eliminated.
 In April, Saeed and three accomplices–Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem, and Shaikh Adil–were charged with Pearl’s kidnapping and murder before Pakistan’s special anti-terrorism court. The trial, initially convened at Karachi’s Central Jail and later moved to a heavily guarded prison in Hyderabad due to security concerns, was closed to journalists and the public.
 In mid-May, as the trial was under way, police found a dismembered body believed to be Pearl’s buried in the outskirts of Karachi on property owned by the Al-Rashid Trust, an Islamic charity that the United States has accused of funneling money to al-Qaeda. Police were reportedly led to the shallow grave by Fazal Karim, a member of the banned militant Sunni Muslim group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. At year’s end, Karim had not been charged, and though it has been widely reported that he was detained, authorities have never officially acknowledged his arrest.
 On July 15, 2002, the anti-terrorism court announced that Saeed and his accomplices were guilty of Pearl’s kidnapping and murder. Saeed, who was accused of masterminding the crime, was sentenced to death by hanging; Saqib, Naseem, and Adil each received 25-year prison sentences. They appealed the ruling.
 Shortly after the ruling, U.S. officials announced DNA test results confirming that the body found in May was indeed Pearl’s.
In mid-August, 2002, The Associated Press (AP) published a detailed account of Pearl’s kidnapping, citing two investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity. The officials said that, according to Karim (who had led police to the journalist’s body in May) and two others held in unofficial custody, Pearl was shot and wounded on the sixth day of his capture when he tried to escape and was murdered on the ninth day. The AP identified the two other detainees as Zubair Chishti and Naeem Bukhari, who is also known as Attaur Rehman and is a leader of the sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The men also said that three Arabs, possibly from Yemen, were brought to the hideout on the ninth day, and that they were involved in filming and carrying out the execution.
 Karim later identified one of the Yemenis among those arrested in a September 11, 2002, raid in Karachi, during which U.S. and Pakistani authorities detained several suspected al-Qaeda members, including Ramzi Binalshibh, allegedly a senior al-Qaeda leader who has claimed a central role in coordinating the September 11 attacks.

In 2007, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, suspected of masterminding the 9/11 attacks in the U.S., was reported to have confessed to a U.S. military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to personally having slit Pearl’s throat, according to news reports. A trial date for Mohammed’s role in the 9/11 attack has been set for January 11, 2021, although it’s not certain if the trial will proceed, according to news reports.



 A former U.S. intelligence officer, Robert Baer, told the United Press International (UPI) news agency in 2002 that he had given Pearl information about Mohammed, and that he believes it was the journalist’s investigations of Mohammed that may have cost him his life. Baer, who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 20 years in Asia and the Middle East and wrote the book See No Evil, which criticizes the CIA, told UPI, ""I have heard from [intelligence] people who follow this closely that it was people close to Mohammed that killed him, if it wasn’t Mohammed himself.""
 UPI quoted a Wall Street Journal spokesperson as saying that, ""Everything we know from before and after Danny’s murder indicates his reporting effort focused on [alleged shoe bomber] Richard Reid.""
On April 2, 2020, the Sindh High Court overturned the murder convictions of the four men accused in Pearl’s killing, according to news reports. The decision found Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had previously been sentenced to death, guilty only of kidnapping Pearl and reduced his sentence to seven years, which he has already served. The Pearl family and the Sindh provincial government appealed, and the four men remained imprisoned as of October 2020, awaiting further action by the Supreme Court, according to news reports.

71,Dekendra Raj Thapa,Radio Nepal,"August 11, 2004",Nepal,Killed,Murder,,"

In August 2004, rebels in midwestern Nepal’s Dailekh District claimed to have killed Dekendra Raj Thapa, a journalist for state-run Radio Nepal and head of a local drinking water project. Local sources told CPJ that Thapa’s killing was connected to his work as a journalist.
After the slaying, local rebel commanders told Thapa’s family that they intended to kill 10 other journalists in neighboring districts, according to local news reports.
Members of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) abducted Thapa on June 26, and a rebel commander said on August 16 that they had executed him on August 11, according to local news reports.
Maoist rebels posted leaflets in Thapa’s hometown in Dailekh on August 17 “charging” him with 10 counts of crimes against what the rebels refer to as their “people’s regime.” Among other accusations, the rebels accused Thapa of spying for state security forces while using his profession as a cover.
Thapa belonged to the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) and was an adviser to the local branch of Human Rights and Peace Society, a Nepalese human rights group. A delegation from FNJ met with Maoists in Dailekh to make appeals on Thapa’s behalf before the rebels said they killed him.
Journalists took to the streets of the capital, Kathmandu, on August 18 to protest Thapa’s killing, according to local news reports. Local journalists said that his killing and the subsequent death threats were intended to silence the press in the Maoist-controlled midwestern districts of Nepal.
In a rare response to journalists’ outrage, Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara wrote a letter to FNJ in September in which he called the murder a breach of policy, promised to investigate the killing and to respect press freedom, and stated that the party had conducted “self-criticism” on the matter.
In January 2013, police arrested five suspects in connection with the killing. In December 2014, a local court convicted them all and sentenced them to two years in prison for the abduction and murder, Agence France-Presse reported. Rights activists and the family slammed the sentence as too lenient; four other former Maoists accused in the murder case were on the run, the report said.
On December 15, 2020, police arrested Hari Lal Pun, a Maoist, according to the local press freedom organization Freedom Forum. Pun had previously been arrested and convicted for his involvement in the killing, but he had fled before completing the last four months of his term, according to that report.
In March 2020, police arrested Bam Bahadur Khadka, one of the four who was on the run at the time of the 2013 sentencing, according to the Freedom Forum.

72,Dhan Bahadur Rokka Magar,Radio Nepal,"January 30, 2003",Nepal,Killed,Murder,,"
Rokka Magar, a newsreader for the Kham Magar­language service of Radio
Nepal, was abducted by Maoist rebels on August 1, 2002, while traveling
by bus to the town of Surkhet, where he worked. Rebels intercepted the
bus near Jaluki, a Maoist-controlled village near the borders of
Western Rolpa and Pyuthan districts, and kidnapped several passengers,
including Rokka Magar and a representative from the British charity
Gurkha Welfare Trust.
It was not clear why the Maoists targeted certain passengers, but
rebels generally view journalists working for state-run Radio Nepal as
government agents.
In October 2004, rebels informed Rokka Magar’s wife, Dil Kumari, that
he had been taken to Khawang, a forested area between Rukum and Rolpa
in midwestern Nepal, and killed in January 2003 on suspicion of spying
for the government, according to local news reports.
The news was first reported in the Nepalese media in March 2005. Rokka
Magar had been on CPJ’s missing list, but his case was reclassified
based on the new reports. The journalist’s body has not been found.

  Sivaram was abducted on the night of April 28 and found dead the next morning from gunshot wounds to the head.
  Four unidentified men forced Sivaram into a jeep as he left a restaurant directly across from the Bambalapitya police station in the capital, according to witness accounts. Police told The Associated Press that they received an anonymous call early the next morning giving the location of Sivaram’s body in Talangama, several miles outside of Colombo. The TamilNet news Web site reported that his body was found in a high-security area behind a parliament building.
  A founding member and contributor to TamilNet and a military and political columnist for the English language Daily Mirror, Sivaram wrote sympathetically about the rebel group the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Police searched his house twice last year looking for weapons but did not find anything.
  The LTTE split into two warring factions in 2004 after a rebel leader known as Colonel Karuna broke away to form his own rival army in eastern Sri Lanka. A cycle of violence has escalated from the east throughout the country, with the warring Tamil factions going on killing sprees that target each other’s alleged supporters, including journalists.
  A pro-LTTE Tamil lawmaker, Amirthanathan Adaikkalanathan, told The Associated Press that Sivaram’s last article for the Tamil-language daily Virekasari criticized the rebel leader Karuna. Sivaram had received death threats in recent weeks, according to exiled Tamil journalists.

75,Dwijamani Singh,Prime News,"December 23, 2012",India,Killed,Dangerous Assignment,,"
Singh was shot dead by police while he was covering a protest in Imphal, the capital of Manipur state. The cameraman, 36, worked for the news division of the satellite-distributed Prime News channel that covers northeast India. News reports initially identified Singh using different spellings of his name.
Prime News reported that Singh was shot in the chest and died at a local hospital. Police said the journalist was shot by accident while they were trying to disperse protesters with live ammunition, according to news reports. Five police officers were suspended, the reports said.
Protesters gathered in Imphal to demonstrate against the reported December 18 public sexual assault of Momoko, a local actress, by members of a separatist group, according to news reports. The protest was also part of mass demonstrations against the sexual assault of women after the December 16 gang rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi.
In December 2012, the All Manipur Working Journalists’ Union and the state government signed a memorandum of understanding in connection with the death of Singh, according to news accounts. The memorandum called for the immediate suspension of the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting, pending investigation; for financial assistance to be provided to the cameraman’s family; and for the creation of media policies to address the welfare of journalists, including those reporting in conflict situations.
That same week, the state government suspended officers ASI K Romendro Singh and Kh Naba-kumar Singh, pending a departmental investigation, reports said.
The state government announced Rs. 500,000 (US $7,400) compensation to the family, according to reports.
According to the journalist union, there were no further proceedings in the case against the police officers. CPJ called the union on several occasions in spring 2016 to seek comment but the calls were not answered. L.M.Khoute, the ADGP, Law and Order did not respond to CPJ’s request for comment in spring 2016.
Local journalists told Al-Jazeera that Singh was survived by two children.

78,Faisal Arefin Dipan,Jagriti Prokashoni,"October 31, 2015",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"

On October 31, 2015, a group of men stabbed Faisal Arefin Dipan, a publisher, to death at the offices of Jagriti Prokashoniin the capital, Dhaka, and then fled the scene, according to news reports. An autopsy report showed the publisher’s body had multiple stab wounds, according to reports.
The publishing house, in the Shahbagh area of the capital, released short stories, poetry, novels, and essays on progressive topics. Dipan’s company had published Biswasher Virus (The Virus of Faith), in 2014 by Avijit Roy, a blogger who received death threats after the book was published, according to reports. Roy was hacked to death in Dhaka in February 2015, CPJ research shows.
Dipan’s father, Abul Kashem Fazlul Haq, told journalists he suspected his son was targeted because he published Roy’s books, news reports said. Friends of the publisher said Dipan had filed a police complaint after death threats appeared on Facebook, The Associated Press reported. CPJ was unable to determine when the threats were made and whether they were posted to his personal or professional Facebook page.
Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent claimed responsibility on social media for the attack on Dipan and a separate attack the same day in which a publisher in Dhaka was severely injured, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorist activity worldwide. One of the statements, which has been viewed by CPJ and which was posted on October 31, 2015, alongside a tweet by someone claiming to be part of Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, said Dipan and the other publisher who was attacked were “worse than the writers of such books, as they helped propagate these books and paid the blasphemers handsome amounts of money for writing them. These secular and atheist publishers waged war against the religion of Islam in every possible ways. One of them also published books in support of homosexuality.”
Bangladeshi police said they were investigating the credibility of claims that Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent is responsible for the killing.
On February 10, 2021, a Bangladesh Court sentenced eight people to death for their involvement in Dipan’s killing, according to news reports.
The court sentenced Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque, Akram Hossain, Abu Siddique Sohel, Mozammel Hossain, Moinul Hasan Shamim, Md Abdus Sabur, Khairul Islam, and Md Sheikh Abdullah to death, and ruled that they had killed Dipan for publishing Roy’s book, those reports said.
Four of the convicted, Haque, Akram Hossain, Mozammel Hossain, and Sohel were also separately convicted and sentenced to death for their role in Roy’s killing, according to news reports. Haque and Akram are in hiding and were sentenced in absentia, while the others are in custody, according to the reports.
The defendants were all members of the banned militant outfit Ansar al-Islam, which is affiliated with Al-Qaeda, according to Al-Jazeera.

At least three unidentified assailants fired at Gauri Lankesh outside her home in Bangalore as she returned home from work on September 5, 2017, according to reports that cited witnesses. She was shot in the head and chest and died immediately, according to a report in the Hindustan Times.
Lankesh published and edited Gauri Lankesh Patrike, a Kannada-language weekly tabloid known for its criticism of right-wing extremism and the establishment, according to media reports. The newspaper covered issues including communal violence and the caste system.
Lankesh was part of a government panel involved in shaping a Maoist surrender to state police, according to reports. According to the BBC, the journalist was sympathetic to the Maoist rebels and was involved in the reintegration of former rebels.
K. Siddaramiah, the chief minister of Karnataka state, ordered a 21-member special investigation team from the police to investigate Lankesh’s killing, according to the Indian Express. 
Inderjit Lankesh, the journalist’s brother, said in an interview with NDTV that India’s national agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, should examine her case. He said that Gauri Lankesh received a lot of hate mail from those who sympathized with the Maoist rebels and said that the investigation should investigate whether Hindu extremists or Maoist rebels are behind the killing, according to India Today. B.T. Venkatesh, a lawyer who represented Gauri Lankesh, alleged in an interview with the media watchdog The Hoot that her murder “was a pre-planned and sinister attack by Hindu terror units.”
The special investigation team filed its initial charge sheet in May 2018, and filed an additional 9,325-page sheet in November 2018, accusing 18 people in connection with the killing, according to a report by NDTV. On January 10, 2020, police made their seventeenth arrest, according to news reports. One suspect remained in hiding as of January 11, according to NDTV.  
Police allege that the killers were members of a criminal syndicate with links to the right-wing Hindu organization Sanatan Sanstha and its offshoot Hindu Janjagruti Samiti, that the suspects were also behind the killings of scholars Narendra Dabholkar and M. M. Kalburgi, and that the syndicate targeted people because of their ideology, according to news reports,
A Sanatan Sanstha representative condemned Lankesh’s killing, according to reports. The group said that the journalist was a Maoist sympathizer who it had nothing to do with, according to reports. 
Lankesh started her career in the 1980s, working as a reporter for English-language dailies including Mid-Day and The Times of India, and the weekly magazine, Sunday. In 2000, after the death of their father, P. Lankesh, Gauri and Indrajit ran Lankesh Patrike, the Kannada-language tabloid their father founded in 1980, according to a profile in Mint. In 2004, she started Gauri Lankesh Patrike.
Lankesh said in an interview with the website NewsLaundry in November 2016, that she had been criticized for her reporting and work. Lankesh said, “Unfortunately, today anybody talking in support of human rights and against fake encounters is branded a Maoist supporter … Along with that, my criticism of Hindutva politics and the caste system, which is part and parcel of what is considered ‘Hindu dharma’ [Hindu duty] makes my critics brand me as a ‘Hindu hater.’”
Lankesh had previously faced legal action over her critical reporting. At the time of her death, she was appealing a six-month prison sentence and fine of 10,000 Indian rupee (US$155) for criminal defamation. The November 2016 conviction was over a 2008 article, according to a report on The Wire. A magistrate granted Lankesh bail and allowed her to appeal the sentence in a higher court, according to a report in The Indian Express. Her lawyer said he didn’t think the killing was related to a defamation case, according to reports.

83,Gautam Das,Samakal,"November 17, 2005",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Das, a reporter for the Dhaka-based daily Samakal, was found strangled in his bureau office in the town of Faridpur, 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of the Bangladeshi capital, according to news reports.
  A colleague called police after repeated telephone calls to Das went unanswered and the door of the Samakal bureau in Faridpur remained locked at midday, according to the local advocacy group Media Watch. At 2 p.m., police broke down the door of the office to find Das’ body inside, with fractures to the legs and hand and nylon rope around his neck, according to a statement by the group.
  Although colleagues were not aware of any specific threat against the reporter, they said that Das had written about sensitive topics such as the activities of Islamist militant groups, according to Media Watch. Sumi Khan, a reporter for Samakal, said that Das was known for his reporting on crime and corruption, including coverage of illegal activities by members of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The Associated Press reported that Das had recently written about local government officials accused of taking bribes in exchange for construction contract awards.
  Two days later, journalist groups around the country protested the killing and criticized the government for not doing more to protect the press.
  On November 19, police arrested Tamjid Hossain Babu, the son of a local MP, in connection with Das’ murder, according to The Daily Star. Local journalists said police arrested three other suspects.
In 2006, Das’ murder case was transferred from the local district court to the Dhaka Speedy Tribunal Court 1 for expedited judgment after pressure from local journalists. One defendant challenged the legality of this transfer, which resulted in further delays, according to reports.
On June 27, 2013, a court sentenced nine individuals to life in prison in connection with Das’ murder. Eight of the nine convicted were junior politicians belonging to the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, including Babu, according to news reports.
At the time, many local journalists hailed the verdict as a landmark, the first time a Bangladeshi court has successfully prosecuted a murder of a journalist.
On January 30, 2019, the High Court upheld the sentences of five of those who were convicted and acquitted four others, according to news reports. The Daily Star reported that the court upheld the life sentences of Asif Imran, Siddiqur Rahman Miah, Asad Bin Kadir, Abu Taher Mohammad Mortuza Ahsan and Tamzid Hossain Babu.

85,Ghulam Rasool,Online International News Network,"August 28, 2014",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
Two unidentified gunmen stormed the offices of the independent news agency Online International News Network in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, killing its reporter-in-training, Ghulam Rasool, also known as Abdul Rasul, and the bureau chief Irshad Mastoi. A network employee, accountant Muhammad Younus, was also killed, according to news reports.
All three were shot several times, according to police. Rasool and Younus were killed immediately, and Mastoi was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead, reports said. The assailants fled the scene, according to reports.
Rasool, who was in his early 20s, was a student in his final year at the media and journalism department of the University of Balochistan Quetta, according to news accounts. He had joined the agency in May 2014 and wrote news reports, but was not assigned to any particular beat. Rasool often accompanied staff journalists on their assignments, his colleagues told CPJ. Prior to working at the agency, Rasool interned with Geo TV, the colleagues said.
Baluchistan–Pakistan’s largest province by area and smallest by population–is mired in an insurgency and sectarian strife. Its residents face criminal activity, daily disappearances, and targeted killings, and international journalists are routinely denied access to the province. Local journalists in Baluchistan face pressure from a number of sources: pro-Taliban groups and Pakistani security forces and intelligence agencies, as well as separatists and state-sponsored anti-separatist militant groups, according to CPJ research.

86,Ghulam Rasool Birhamani,Daily Sindhu Hyderabad,"May 9 or 10, 2010",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
The body of Birhamani, 40, a reporter for the Daily Sindhu
Hyderabad, was found outside his hometown of Wahi Pandhi, Sindh province, on
May 10, a day after he was reported kidnapped. The Pakistan Federal Union of
Journalists and the media support group Pakistan Press Foundation reported that
his body was badly scarred and showed evidence of torture.
Birhamani’s family believed he was killed because of his
reporting on ethnic issues in Sindh province, the journalists union said. A
colleague told the newspaper Dawn that Birhamani’s story on the marriage of a
12-year-old girl to a 22-year-old man might have been the specific trigger for
the attack. Birhamani had received threats from members of the Lashari tribe
just days before he was seized, the press foundation said.
Hundreds of journalists turned out for a march to protest
his killing. Dawn quoted some of the demonstrators as saying that police were
reluctant to investigate because of political sensitivities. The journalists
union said Birhamani had worked for many years for various Sindhi-language
dailies. He left behind a wife, two sons, and a daughter.

Khadka, 35, a journalist with the state-owned news agency Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS), was brutally murdered in Nepal’s eastern Sindhupalchowk District by a group of suspected Maoist rebels.
According to RSS, the rebels took Khadka away from a school where he taught part time and led him to a nearby field, where they tied his hands to a pole and slit his throat. No motive is known for his murder, but during Nepal’s 7-year-old civil war, both rebels and government security forces have targeted journalists. Local journalists believe that the rebels killed Khadka because he was a journalist.
Khadka is the first journalist to be killed in Nepal since the rebels broke a cease-fire agreement with government forces in August. His murder came amid intensified violence in the country, as well as increased attacks on journalists.
Khadka’s murder has outraged the journalistic community in Nepal. A group of at least 30 journalists gathered to peacefully protest the killing on September 11, but police dispersed them and detained them briefly for defying a ban on demonstrations.

89,Harunur Rashid,Dainik Purbanchal,"March 2, 2002",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Rashid, a reporter for the Bengali-language newspaper Dainik Purbanchal,
was ambushed by gunmen while he was riding his motorcycle to work in
the southwestern city of Khulna, according to Bangladeshi and
international news reports. Dainik Purbanchal, which is published in Khulna, is a well-regarded regional daily.
Three unidentified young men brought Rashid to a hospital, told doctors
he had been injured in a car accident, and then disappeared. A doctor
at the hospital told the Dhaka-based newspaper The Independent that Rashid had suffered a fatal bullet wound to his chest.
Rashid, also known as Rashid Khukon, was a crime reporter who had
written several stories on official corruption and links between
criminal syndicates and outlawed Maoist guerrilla groups, including the
Purbo Bangla Communist Party (PBCP). Rashid’s relatives told reporters
that he was on a PBCP hit list. Though the PBCP issued a statement
denying responsibility for Rashid’s murder, some colleagues said a
splinter faction of the group may be behind the killing.
The reporter had received anonymous death threats throughout his career
and, for the last year, had been provided police protection. However,
he did not always travel with security guards.
Local journalists believe Rashid was killed for his reporting. Amiya
Kanti Pal, a former colleague, told Reuters that, “Rashid was a brave
reporter. We suspect that the criminals he wrote about might be behind
his murder.”
          The Criminal Investigation Department, a federal law enforcement body, is investigating the case.

90,Hayatullah Khan,freelance,"June 16, 2006",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
Khan’s body was found by villagers in the North Waziristan
town of Miran Shah, where he had been kidnapped six months earlier. Khan was
abducted on December 5, 2005, by five gunmen who ran his car off the road as
his younger brother, Haseenullah, watched helplessly. Local government
officials and family members said Khan, 32, had been found handcuffed and shot
several times. His body appeared frail and he had grown a long beard since he
was last seen, Pakistani journalists told CPJ.
The day before his abduction, Khan photographed what
apparently were the remnants of a U.S.-made missile said to have struck a house
in Miran Shah on December 1, 2005, killing senior Al-Qaeda figure Hamza Rabia.
The pictures, widely distributed by the European Pressphoto Agency on the day
they were shot, contradicted the Pakistani government’s explanation that Rabia
had died in a blast caused by explosives within the house. International news media
identified the fragments in the photographs as part of a Hellfire missile,
possibly fired from a U.S. drone.
Khan, who was also a reporter for the Urdu-language daily
Ausaf, had received numerous threats from Pakistani security forces, Taliban
members, and local tribesmen because of his reporting.
During Khan’s six-month disappearance, government officials
provided his family with numerous and often contradictory accounts of his
whereabouts: Khan was in government custody, soon to be released; Khan had been
abducted by  “miscreants”;  he had been taken by Waziristan mujahideen;
he had been flown to the military base at Rawalpindi and was then detained in
Kohat air base.
Khan’s relatives were told by hospital workers that he had
five or six bullet wounds and that one hand had been manacled in handcuffs
typically used by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate. Mahmud
Ali Durrani, Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, dismissed the reported
presence of the handcuffs as circumstantial and said the cuffs could have been
planted to incriminate the government. No autopsy was performed.
An investigation led by High Court Justice Mohammed Reza
Khan was conducted, but the results were not made public. Hayatullah Khan’s
family said they were not interviewed by the judge or other investigators.
North West Frontier Gov. Ali Mohammad Jan Orakzai told CPJ that North
Waziristan was not secure enough to risk exposing a judicial figure to
kidnapping or death. CPJ has repeatedly sought the release of the report,
making a direct request to President Asif Ali Zardari in 2011. The report
remained a secret as of February 2013.
In November 2007, Khan’s widow was killed in a bomb that was
detonated outside her home.

91,Humayun Kabir,Janmabhumi,"June 24, 2004",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"

On June 24, 2004, an unidentified assailant threw bombs at Humayun Kabir, editor of the Bangla-language daily Janmabhumi, while he was outside his home in the southwestern Bangladeshi city of Khulna with his family, killing him, according to local news reports.
Witnesses told the English-language Daily Star that the assailant, posing as a peanut seller, approached Kabir and tossed at least two homemade bombs at him, critically injuring him in the abdomen and the legs. Kabir was taken to Khulna Medical College Hospital and died soon thereafter. Kabir’s son Asif also suffered minor injuries on his legs and was treated at a local clinic.
An underground leftist group known as Janajuddha (People’s War), a faction of the Purbo Banglar Communist Party, claimed responsibility for the killing in phone calls to several local newspapers and journalists the day of the murder, according to local journalists.
Kabir, 58, was a veteran journalist and the president of the Khulna Press Club. He published bold articles criticizing organized crime groups in Bangladesh’s southwestern region. After his friend and fellow journalist Manik Saha was killed in a similar attack earlier in 2004, Kabir criticized the criminal groups implicated in Saha’s killing. Janajuddha also claimed responsibility for killing Saha.
Kabir had recently received death threats, according to local news reports.
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and other high-ranking government officials condemned Kabir’s murder and pledged to find and punish those responsible. Local journalist groups spoke out against the killing and called for a week of mourning.
Shortly after the attack, local police said they detained nine suspects, the BBC reported.
Two other suspects in the case, leaders of the Janajuddha faction, died in separate shootouts with police in late August 2004. Authorities accuse the deceased suspects–Altaf Hossain and Imam Sarder–of involvement in Kabir’s killing and say they were also responsible for killing Saha, according to local news reports.
In 2008, seven of the accused were acquitted, according to the Daily Star. On January 18, 2021, a court in Khulna sentenced five people to life in prison and fined them 10,000 Takas (US $118) for their involvement in the killing, according to that report, which identified the five as Syed Iqbal Hossain, Zahid Hossain, Nazul, Masum, and Rimon, and noted that Masum had absconded at the time of the sentencing.

He was found in the street and taken to a hospital, where he was declared dead. 
Hossain’s wife Zuleka Begum filed a murder case with the police that evening, naming eight suspects, according to news reports. Within a day of the murder, police had arrested three suspects in the case, and sought five more, according to the reports, which quoted an officer in charge at the Bandar Police Station, in Narayanganj. One of the suspects confessed to the murder in police custody and later before a magistrate, according to the reports.
CPJ’s text messages to officers at the Bandar Police Station were not answered.
The murder was carried out in revenge for Hossain’s articles in the Dainik Bijoy, which CPJ has seen, alleging that the suspects illegally connected gas lines, according to those reports. As a result of the allegations, the suspects were jailed but carried out the alleged murder after they were released on bail, according to the reports.

98,Jagendra Singh,Freelance,"June 8, 2015",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Jagendra Singh, a freelance journalist who reported critically on politics and current affairs in Hindi-language newspapers and on Facebook, died from burn injuries he sustained after a police raid at his home on June 1, local reports said.
While being treated in hospital for burns covering more than half of his body, Singh made a statement to a police officer, Amitabh Thakur, in which he said another police officer, Sriprakash Rai, had doused him in petrol and set him on fire, the Press Trust of India reported.
Thakur said he has video footage of Singh’s statement, according to reports. In the statement, news reports cite the journalist as saying, “Prakash Rai was there and along with him were present four, five police personnel. The police team, led by Prakash Rai, barged into the house and started assaulting me. They could have as well arrested me.”
The journalist also accused Ram Murti Singh Verma, a member of the ruling Samajwadi Party in India’s most populous state, of “unleashing a reign of terror” on him and his family in reprisal for his investigative reports and critical comments against the minister, Times News Network reported. “Why did they have to burn me?” he reportedly says in the video. “If the minister and his people had something against me, they could have hit me and beaten me instead of pouring kerosene over me and burning me.”
Singh also told Thakur that his foot was broken during an earlier attack on April 28 near his house, by people he alleged were “the minister’s henchmen.”
Singh’s son, Raghvendra, filed a police complaint that named Verma and Rai, according to the Press Trust of India. Raghvendra Singh told The Associated Press that police “barged into our house and questioned my father about the posts. … They started beating him up. … They poured petrol over him and set him on fire.”
Police Superintendent Babloo Kumar told CPJ in 2015 that Singh killed himself when police attempted to arrest him. He said Singh was “wanted in a crime” and denied that he was a journalist, saying “he only wrote on social media.” When asked for further details, Kumar told CPJ Singh was wanted for murder. He said “I don’t remember” when CPJ asked for details of the murder in which the journalist was accused of being involved.
In September 2016, The Times of India reported that Uttar Pradesh state police had dropped the charges against Singh that they had said were the reason for his arrest. According to the report, police in May 2015 registered a case of attempted murder and kidnapping against Singh after a complaint by Amit Bhadauria, also a journalist.
Singh wrote on local politics and current affairs in Hindi-language newspapers and on his two Facebook pages, which have more than 4,000 followers combined. English- and Hindi-language news reports did not specify what newspapers he had written for. His son said Singh posted news stories on Facebook based on information he obtained through India’s Right to Information law and other sources, according to The Indian Express.
Singh often wrote critically about Verma, alleging that he was involved in illegal mining and land grabs, the reports said. In a May 31 Hindi-language Facebook post with an accompanying photo of Verma, the journalist alleged that the minister was involved in the gang rape of a local woman, claims that were also reported in Hindi-language media. In another post a day earlier, Singh questioned the land holdings amassed by the minister.
In a Facebook post on May 22, Singh wrote: “Ram Murti Singh Verma can have me killed. At this time, politician, thugs, and police, all are after me. Writing the truth is bearing heavily on my life. After exposing some of Ram Murti Verma’s acts, he had me attacked…”
CPJ was not able to reach Verma for response to the allegations against him.
No arrests were made immediately after Singh’s death. In the days following Singh’s death, local journalists and members of other political parties called on the chief minister of the state, Akhilesh Yadav, to remove Verma from his cabinet, according to news reports. A public interest litigation filed at the Allahabad High Court demanded a probe by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, news reports said.

K. Siddaramiah, the chief minister of Karnataka state, ordered a 21-member special investigation team from the police to investigate Lankesh’s killing, according to the Indian Express. 
Inderjit Lankesh, the journalist’s brother, said in an interview with NDTV that India’s national agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, should examine her case. He said that Gauri Lankesh received a lot of hate mail from those who sympathized with the Maoist rebels and said that the investigation should investigate whether Hindu extremists or Maoist rebels are behind the killing, according to India Today. B.T. Venkatesh, a lawyer who represented Gauri Lankesh, alleged in an interview with the media watchdog The Hoot that her murder “was a pre-planned and sinister attack by Hindu terror units.”
The special investigation team filed its initial charge sheet in May 2018, and filed an additional 9,325-page sheet in November 2018, accusing 18 people in connection with the killing, according to a report by NDTV. On January 10, 2020, police made their seventeenth arrest, according to news reports. One suspect remained in hiding as of January 11, according to NDTV.  
Police allege that the killers were members of a criminal syndicate with links to the right-wing Hindu organization Sanatan Sanstha and its offshoot Hindu Janjagruti Samiti, that the suspects were also behind the killings of scholars Narendra Dabholkar and M. M. Kalburgi, and that the syndicate targeted people because of their ideology, according to news reports,
A Sanatan Sanstha representative condemned Lankesh’s killing, according to reports. The group said that the journalist was a Maoist sympathizer who it had nothing to do with, according to reports. 
Lankesh started her career in the 1980s, working as a reporter for English-language dailies including Mid-Day and The Times of India, and the weekly magazine, Sunday. In 2000, after the death of their father, P. Lankesh, Gauri and Indrajit ran Lankesh Patrike, the Kannada-language tabloid their father founded in 1980, according to a profile in Mint. In 2004, she started Gauri Lankesh Patrike.
Lankesh said in an interview with the website NewsLaundry in November 2016, that she had been criticized for her reporting and work. Lankesh said, “Unfortunately, today anybody talking in support of human rights and against fake encounters is branded a Maoist supporter … Along with that, my criticism of Hindutva politics and the caste system, which is part and parcel of what is considered ‘Hindu dharma’ [Hindu duty] makes my critics brand me as a ‘Hindu hater.’”
Lankesh had previously faced legal action over her critical reporting. At the time of her death, she was appealing a six-month prison sentence and fine of 10,000 Indian rupee (US$155) for criminal defamation. The November 2016 conviction was over a 2008 article, according to a report on The Wire. A magistrate granted Lankesh bail and allowed her to appeal the sentence in a higher court, according to a report in The Indian Express. Her lawyer said he didn’t think the killing was related to a defamation case, according to reports.

103,Gautam Das,Samakal,"November 17, 2005",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Das, a reporter for the Dhaka-based daily Samakal, was found strangled in his bureau office in the town of Faridpur, 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of the Bangladeshi capital, according to news reports.
  A colleague called police after repeated telephone calls to Das went unanswered and the door of the Samakal bureau in Faridpur remained locked at midday, according to the local advocacy group Media Watch. At 2 p.m., police broke down the door of the office to find Das’ body inside, with fractures to the legs and hand and nylon rope around his neck, according to a statement by the group.
  Although colleagues were not aware of any specific threat against the reporter, they said that Das had written about sensitive topics such as the activities of Islamist militant groups, according to Media Watch. Sumi Khan, a reporter for Samakal, said that Das was known for his reporting on crime and corruption, including coverage of illegal activities by members of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The Associated Press reported that Das had recently written about local government officials accused of taking bribes in exchange for construction contract awards.
  Two days later, journalist groups around the country protested the killing and criticized the government for not doing more to protect the press.
  On November 19, police arrested Tamjid Hossain Babu, the son of a local MP, in connection with Das’ murder, according to The Daily Star. Local journalists said police arrested three other suspects.
In 2006, Das’ murder case was transferred from the local district court to the Dhaka Speedy Tribunal Court 1 for expedited judgment after pressure from local journalists. One defendant challenged the legality of this transfer, which resulted in further delays, according to reports.
On June 27, 2013, a court sentenced nine individuals to life in prison in connection with Das’ murder. Eight of the nine convicted were junior politicians belonging to the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, including Babu, according to news reports.
At the time, many local journalists hailed the verdict as a landmark, the first time a Bangladeshi court has successfully prosecuted a murder of a journalist.
On January 30, 2019, the High Court upheld the sentences of five of those who were convicted and acquitted four others, according to news reports. The Daily Star reported that the court upheld the life sentences of Asif Imran, Siddiqur Rahman Miah, Asad Bin Kadir, Abu Taher Mohammad Mortuza Ahsan and Tamzid Hossain Babu.

105,Ghulam Rasool,Online International News Network,"August 28, 2014",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
Two unidentified gunmen stormed the offices of the independent news agency Online International News Network in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, killing its reporter-in-training, Ghulam Rasool, also known as Abdul Rasul, and the bureau chief Irshad Mastoi. A network employee, accountant Muhammad Younus, was also killed, according to news reports.
All three were shot several times, according to police. Rasool and Younus were killed immediately, and Mastoi was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead, reports said. The assailants fled the scene, according to reports.
Rasool, who was in his early 20s, was a student in his final year at the media and journalism department of the University of Balochistan Quetta, according to news accounts. He had joined the agency in May 2014 and wrote news reports, but was not assigned to any particular beat. Rasool often accompanied staff journalists on their assignments, his colleagues told CPJ. Prior to working at the agency, Rasool interned with Geo TV, the colleagues said.
Baluchistan–Pakistan’s largest province by area and smallest by population–is mired in an insurgency and sectarian strife. Its residents face criminal activity, daily disappearances, and targeted killings, and international journalists are routinely denied access to the province. Local journalists in Baluchistan face pressure from a number of sources: pro-Taliban groups and Pakistani security forces and intelligence agencies, as well as separatists and state-sponsored anti-separatist militant groups, according to CPJ research.

106,Ghulam Rasool Birhamani,Daily Sindhu Hyderabad,"May 9 or 10, 2010",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
The body of Birhamani, 40, a reporter for the Daily Sindhu
Hyderabad, was found outside his hometown of Wahi Pandhi, Sindh province, on
May 10, a day after he was reported kidnapped. The Pakistan Federal Union of
Journalists and the media support group Pakistan Press Foundation reported that
his body was badly scarred and showed evidence of torture.
Birhamani’s family believed he was killed because of his
reporting on ethnic issues in Sindh province, the journalists union said. A
colleague told the newspaper Dawn that Birhamani’s story on the marriage of a
12-year-old girl to a 22-year-old man might have been the specific trigger for
the attack. Birhamani had received threats from members of the Lashari tribe
just days before he was seized, the press foundation said.
Hundreds of journalists turned out for a march to protest
his killing. Dawn quoted some of the demonstrators as saying that police were
reluctant to investigate because of political sensitivities. The journalists
union said Birhamani had worked for many years for various Sindhi-language
dailies. He left behind a wife, two sons, and a daughter.

Khadka, 35, a journalist with the state-owned news agency Rastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS), was brutally murdered in Nepal’s eastern Sindhupalchowk District by a group of suspected Maoist rebels.
According to RSS, the rebels took Khadka away from a school where he taught part time and led him to a nearby field, where they tied his hands to a pole and slit his throat. No motive is known for his murder, but during Nepal’s 7-year-old civil war, both rebels and government security forces have targeted journalists. Local journalists believe that the rebels killed Khadka because he was a journalist.
Khadka is the first journalist to be killed in Nepal since the rebels broke a cease-fire agreement with government forces in August. His murder came amid intensified violence in the country, as well as increased attacks on journalists.
Khadka’s murder has outraged the journalistic community in Nepal. A group of at least 30 journalists gathered to peacefully protest the killing on September 11, but police dispersed them and detained them briefly for defying a ban on demonstrations.

109,Harunur Rashid,Dainik Purbanchal,"March 2, 2002",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Rashid, a reporter for the Bengali-language newspaper Dainik Purbanchal,
was ambushed by gunmen while he was riding his motorcycle to work in
the southwestern city of Khulna, according to Bangladeshi and
international news reports. Dainik Purbanchal, which is published in Khulna, is a well-regarded regional daily.
Three unidentified young men brought Rashid to a hospital, told doctors
he had been injured in a car accident, and then disappeared. A doctor
at the hospital told the Dhaka-based newspaper The Independent that Rashid had suffered a fatal bullet wound to his chest.
Rashid, also known as Rashid Khukon, was a crime reporter who had
written several stories on official corruption and links between
criminal syndicates and outlawed Maoist guerrilla groups, including the
Purbo Bangla Communist Party (PBCP). Rashid’s relatives told reporters
that he was on a PBCP hit list. Though the PBCP issued a statement
denying responsibility for Rashid’s murder, some colleagues said a
splinter faction of the group may be behind the killing.
The reporter had received anonymous death threats throughout his career
and, for the last year, had been provided police protection. However,
he did not always travel with security guards.
Local journalists believe Rashid was killed for his reporting. Amiya
Kanti Pal, a former colleague, told Reuters that, “Rashid was a brave
reporter. We suspect that the criminals he wrote about might be behind
his murder.”
          The Criminal Investigation Department, a federal law enforcement body, is investigating the case.

110,Hayatullah Khan,freelance,"June 16, 2006",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
Khan’s body was found by villagers in the North Waziristan
town of Miran Shah, where he had been kidnapped six months earlier. Khan was
abducted on December 5, 2005, by five gunmen who ran his car off the road as
his younger brother, Haseenullah, watched helplessly. Local government
officials and family members said Khan, 32, had been found handcuffed and shot
several times. His body appeared frail and he had grown a long beard since he
was last seen, Pakistani journalists told CPJ.
The day before his abduction, Khan photographed what
apparently were the remnants of a U.S.-made missile said to have struck a house
in Miran Shah on December 1, 2005, killing senior Al-Qaeda figure Hamza Rabia.
The pictures, widely distributed by the European Pressphoto Agency on the day
they were shot, contradicted the Pakistani government’s explanation that Rabia
had died in a blast caused by explosives within the house. International news media
identified the fragments in the photographs as part of a Hellfire missile,
possibly fired from a U.S. drone.
Khan, who was also a reporter for the Urdu-language daily
Ausaf, had received numerous threats from Pakistani security forces, Taliban
members, and local tribesmen because of his reporting.
During Khan’s six-month disappearance, government officials
provided his family with numerous and often contradictory accounts of his
whereabouts: Khan was in government custody, soon to be released; Khan had been
abducted by  “miscreants”;  he had been taken by Waziristan mujahideen;
he had been flown to the military base at Rawalpindi and was then detained in
Kohat air base.
Khan’s relatives were told by hospital workers that he had
five or six bullet wounds and that one hand had been manacled in handcuffs
typically used by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate. Mahmud
Ali Durrani, Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, dismissed the reported
presence of the handcuffs as circumstantial and said the cuffs could have been
planted to incriminate the government. No autopsy was performed.
An investigation led by High Court Justice Mohammed Reza
Khan was conducted, but the results were not made public. Hayatullah Khan’s
family said they were not interviewed by the judge or other investigators.
North West Frontier Gov. Ali Mohammad Jan Orakzai told CPJ that North
Waziristan was not secure enough to risk exposing a judicial figure to
kidnapping or death. CPJ has repeatedly sought the release of the report,
making a direct request to President Asif Ali Zardari in 2011. The report
remained a secret as of February 2013.
In November 2007, Khan’s widow was killed in a bomb that was
detonated outside her home.

111,Humayun Kabir,Janmabhumi,"June 24, 2004",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"

On June 24, 2004, an unidentified assailant threw bombs at Humayun Kabir, editor of the Bangla-language daily Janmabhumi, while he was outside his home in the southwestern Bangladeshi city of Khulna with his family, killing him, according to local news reports.
Witnesses told the English-language Daily Star that the assailant, posing as a peanut seller, approached Kabir and tossed at least two homemade bombs at him, critically injuring him in the abdomen and the legs. Kabir was taken to Khulna Medical College Hospital and died soon thereafter. Kabir’s son Asif also suffered minor injuries on his legs and was treated at a local clinic.
An underground leftist group known as Janajuddha (People’s War), a faction of the Purbo Banglar Communist Party, claimed responsibility for the killing in phone calls to several local newspapers and journalists the day of the murder, according to local journalists.
Kabir, 58, was a veteran journalist and the president of the Khulna Press Club. He published bold articles criticizing organized crime groups in Bangladesh’s southwestern region. After his friend and fellow journalist Manik Saha was killed in a similar attack earlier in 2004, Kabir criticized the criminal groups implicated in Saha’s killing. Janajuddha also claimed responsibility for killing Saha.
Kabir had recently received death threats, according to local news reports.
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and other high-ranking government officials condemned Kabir’s murder and pledged to find and punish those responsible. Local journalist groups spoke out against the killing and called for a week of mourning.
Shortly after the attack, local police said they detained nine suspects, the BBC reported.
Two other suspects in the case, leaders of the Janajuddha faction, died in separate shootouts with police in late August 2004. Authorities accuse the deceased suspects–Altaf Hossain and Imam Sarder–of involvement in Kabir’s killing and say they were also responsible for killing Saha, according to local news reports.
In 2008, seven of the accused were acquitted, according to the Daily Star. On January 18, 2021, a court in Khulna sentenced five people to life in prison and fined them 10,000 Takas (US $118) for their involvement in the killing, according to that report, which identified the five as Syed Iqbal Hossain, Zahid Hossain, Nazul, Masum, and Rimon, and noted that Masum had absconded at the time of the sentencing.

He was found in the street and taken to a hospital, where he was declared dead. 
Hossain’s wife Zuleka Begum filed a murder case with the police that evening, naming eight suspects, according to news reports. Within a day of the murder, police had arrested three suspects in the case, and sought five more, according to the reports, which quoted an officer in charge at the Bandar Police Station, in Narayanganj. One of the suspects confessed to the murder in police custody and later before a magistrate, according to the reports.
CPJ’s text messages to officers at the Bandar Police Station were not answered.
The murder was carried out in revenge for Hossain’s articles in the Dainik Bijoy, which CPJ has seen, alleging that the suspects illegally connected gas lines, according to those reports. As a result of the allegations, the suspects were jailed but carried out the alleged murder after they were released on bail, according to the reports.

118,Jagendra Singh,Freelance,"June 8, 2015",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Jagendra Singh, a freelance journalist who reported critically on politics and current affairs in Hindi-language newspapers and on Facebook, died from burn injuries he sustained after a police raid at his home on June 1, local reports said.
While being treated in hospital for burns covering more than half of his body, Singh made a statement to a police officer, Amitabh Thakur, in which he said another police officer, Sriprakash Rai, had doused him in petrol and set him on fire, the Press Trust of India reported.
Thakur said he has video footage of Singh’s statement, according to reports. In the statement, news reports cite the journalist as saying, “Prakash Rai was there and along with him were present four, five police personnel. The police team, led by Prakash Rai, barged into the house and started assaulting me. They could have as well arrested me.”
The journalist also accused Ram Murti Singh Verma, a member of the ruling Samajwadi Party in India’s most populous state, of “unleashing a reign of terror” on him and his family in reprisal for his investigative reports and critical comments against the minister, Times News Network reported. “Why did they have to burn me?” he reportedly says in the video. “If the minister and his people had something against me, they could have hit me and beaten me instead of pouring kerosene over me and burning me.”
Singh also told Thakur that his foot was broken during an earlier attack on April 28 near his house, by people he alleged were “the minister’s henchmen.”
Singh’s son, Raghvendra, filed a police complaint that named Verma and Rai, according to the Press Trust of India. Raghvendra Singh told The Associated Press that police “barged into our house and questioned my father about the posts. … They started beating him up. … They poured petrol over him and set him on fire.”
Police Superintendent Babloo Kumar told CPJ in 2015 that Singh killed himself when police attempted to arrest him. He said Singh was “wanted in a crime” and denied that he was a journalist, saying “he only wrote on social media.” When asked for further details, Kumar told CPJ Singh was wanted for murder. He said “I don’t remember” when CPJ asked for details of the murder in which the journalist was accused of being involved.
In September 2016, The Times of India reported that Uttar Pradesh state police had dropped the charges against Singh that they had said were the reason for his arrest. According to the report, police in May 2015 registered a case of attempted murder and kidnapping against Singh after a complaint by Amit Bhadauria, also a journalist.
Singh wrote on local politics and current affairs in Hindi-language newspapers and on his two Facebook pages, which have more than 4,000 followers combined. English- and Hindi-language news reports did not specify what newspapers he had written for. His son said Singh posted news stories on Facebook based on information he obtained through India’s Right to Information law and other sources, according to The Indian Express.
Singh often wrote critically about Verma, alleging that he was involved in illegal mining and land grabs, the reports said. In a May 31 Hindi-language Facebook post with an accompanying photo of Verma, the journalist alleged that the minister was involved in the gang rape of a local woman, claims that were also reported in Hindi-language media. In another post a day earlier, Singh questioned the land holdings amassed by the minister.
In a Facebook post on May 22, Singh wrote: “Ram Murti Singh Verma can have me killed. At this time, politician, thugs, and police, all are after me. Writing the truth is bearing heavily on my life. After exposing some of Ram Murti Verma’s acts, he had me attacked…”
CPJ was not able to reach Verma for response to the allegations against him.
No arrests were made immediately after Singh’s death. In the days following Singh’s death, local journalists and members of other political parties called on the chief minister of the state, Akhilesh Yadav, to remove Verma from his cabinet, according to news reports. A public interest litigation filed at the Allahabad High Court demanded a probe by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, news reports said.

Three suspects–Qutubur Rahman, Mohammed Tuta Miyan and Mohhamed Joynul Haque have been arrested in connection with Muslimmuddin’s murder, according to news reports. Ajit Kumar Bhuyan, the editor of Asomiya Pratidin, said he suspected a nexus of a bigger criminal gang and powerful people in the area were behind the attack, according to reports.

127,Mukarram Khan Aatif,Freelance,"January 17, 2012",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"


Two gunmen killed Aatif, a reporter for the Pashto-language
service of the U.S. government-funded Voice of America, at a mosque in
Shabqadar, north of Peshawar. The assailants, who struck during evening
prayers, shot Aatif multiple times before fleeing on motorcycles, police told
reporters. Aatif died of his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar. An
imam was injured in the attack.
Taliban spokesmen spoke to several news outlets, taking
responsibility for the killing. Ihsanullah Ihsan told The Associated Press that
Aatif had been warned “a number of times to stop anti-Taliban reporting, but he
didn’t do so. He finally met his fate.”
Several CPJ sources said they were skeptical Aatif had been
killed on the orders of the Taliban or for the publicly stated reasons. Aatif
told friends and relatives that he started receiving threats from military and
intelligence officials immediately after covering a November 2011 attack by
U.S.-led NATO forces on Pakistani army check posts at Salala, near the border
with Afghanistan. Twenty-four Pakistani soldiers died in the attack. Aatif
filed reports on the attack for Deewa Radio and took part in what are called
two-ways, which are live exchanges with the station’s studio journalists. 
Aatif had spoken to local residents who said a Taliban
hideout was just two kilometers from the army check posts, a tribal area
journalist told CPJ. The Taliban’s proximity to the army posts was highly
sensitive information because it could have provided justification for the
American attack. An official with the U.S. National Security Council told CPJ
that a Special Forces team launched the attack after taking fire from the area
of the Pakistani check posts. 
Deewa Radio said Aatif’s reports explained the geography of
the area but did not mention the Taliban. Deewa did not respond to CPJ’s
repeated queries seeking information on what was said by the station’s studio
journalists during their live two-way exchanges with Aatif. Deewa said no
archive of Aatif’s reports was available. Multiple CPJ sources in Pakistan and
the United States said the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate was believed
to be behind the murder. A Pakistani security official said the speculation was
unsubstantiated.

128,Munir Ahmed Sangi,Kawish Television Network,"May 29, 2006",Pakistan,Killed,Crossfire,,"
Sangi, a cameraman for the Sindhi-language channel, was shot
while covering a gunfight between members of the Unar and Abro tribes in the town
of Larkana, in southeast Pakistan’s Sindh district, according to local media
reports. At least one other person was killed in the clash, which Sangi
recorded before he died. The station broadcast his video.
Police said Sangi was killed in crossfire, although some
colleagues believe he might have been deliberately targeted for the station’s
reporting on a jirga, or tribal council, held by leaders of the Unar tribe,
according to the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists. An uncle and colleague
of Sangi had recently been attacked in connection with the station’s reports
that two children had been punished by the tribal court, the journalist union
said.
Mazhar Abbas, then the secretary-general of the journalist
union, said Sangi’s body was not recovered for several hours after he was shot.
Journalists in Larkana staged a sit-in to protest the killing of their
colleague.
The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said
Sangi had received threats in connection with his coverage of alleged abuses by
Altaf Hussain Unar, a provincial minister. The Sindh Home Department said that
four people were arrested after Sangi’s death and that three police officials
were suspended. Unar was arrested in a separate case in 2008, but was not
charged in relation to the killing of Sangi.
Despite the initial arrests, the suspects were never brought
to trial, according to Hadi Sangi, brother of the slain journalist, and court
documents reviewed by CPJ. Hadi Sangi also said that he and his brother’s
widow, Reshman Sangi, had received repeated threats.

No one claimed responsibility for the killing of Khankhel,
who died in the first violation of a truce called two days earlier between the
government and local militant groups, according to local and international news
reports. Khankhel was targeted while covering a peace march led by Muslim
cleric Sufi Muhammad, father-in-law of local Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah,
the reports said. Muhammad was seeking to recruit his son-in-law to join a
cease-fire agreement he had negotiated with the government. 
Geo Managing Director Azhar Abbas told CPJ that Khankhel had
become separated from the rest of his four-person reporting team in a
militant-controlled area near the town of Matta. He suffered multiple gunshot
wounds to the torso and back of the head, Abbas said. A BBC report citing
Khankhel’s brother said the journalist had been abducted at gunpoint from the
peace march, and that his hands and feet were bound when his body was
discovered.
Khankhel had told supervisors that the army was retaliating
against him for his aggressive coverage of the military offensive in Swat. He
said he was being threatened, denied access, and barred from news conferences.
Hamid Mir, his supervisor at the time, told CPJ that Khankhel called him on the
day of the murder to say that he feared for his life and believed the
Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate intended to kill him. Mir said Khankel
was killed just hours later.

132,MVN Shankar,Andhra Prabha,"November 26, 2014",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Shankar died at a local hospital a day after being beaten by unidentified assailants with iron rods, according to news reports. The journalist was returning home after filing a report in Chilakaluripet town in Guntur district in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
Shankar was a senior journalist for the Telugu-language daily Andhra Prabha, who had frequently reported on the “oil mafia,” a common term for criminals who intercept shipments of kerosene oil and gas and thin it down with much cheaper oil, according to news reports. Shankar had also written about corruption in the rice mill trade shortly before his death, according to The Hoot, a South Asian media watchdog group. The journalist, who was also honorary president of a Guntur press club had written a series of stories on allegations of corruption in the public distribution system, news reports said.
A statement by the Indian Journalists Union said Shankar was killed for his coverage of a group that had engaged in the illegal sale on the black market of rationed essential items, including kerosene oil, for the poor, which was supplied through the country’s food security system known as the Public Distribution System, reports said. Thirty-eight percent of kerosene is smuggled or misused to adulterate diesel oil, according to news reports citing the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.
In January 2013, an activist was murdered in the nearby Maharashtra state after he exposed the illegal sales of kerosene oil and ration cards. An official working as a district collector was burned alive in Maharashtra state in 2011, allegedly by members of the “oil mafia,” according to news accounts.
The Minister for Agriculture, P. Pulla Rao, condemned the murder and ordered an investigation. A day later, Nimmakayala China Rajappa, the Andhra Pradesh home minister, directed police to form a special team to investigate the case and promised Shankar’s family that justice would be served, according to The Hoot.
In April 2016, Narayan Naik, superintendent of police for Guntar, told CPJ a suspect had been charged in connection with the murder, but did not provide further details.

Shankar is survived by his wife, according to news accounts.

On the night of October 19, a group of unidentified gunmen approached the home of Nimalarajan, a Jaffna-based journalist who reported for various news organizations, including the BBC’s Tamil and Sinhala-language services, the Tamil-language daily Virakesari, and the Sinhala-language weekly Ravaya.
 The assailants shot the journalist through the window of his study, where he was working on an article, and threw a grenade into the home before fleeing the premises. The attack occurred during curfew hours in a high-security zone in central Jaffna town. Army officers were summoned to the house, and they took the journalist to Jaffna Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The journalist’s parents and his 11-year-old nephew were seriously injured in the attack.
 Local journalists suspect that Nimalarajan’s reporting on vote-rigging and intimidation in Jaffna during the recent parliamentary elections may have led to his murder.
 Sri Lankan president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga ordered defense authorities to launch an immediate inquiry into the assassination. In an October 20 letter, CPJ urged the president to ensure that the investigation was pursued vigorously and its findings made public.
 Police failed to respond to repeated requests for information regarding the status of the investigation, which appeared to have stalled by year’s end.

Ali, a correspondent for the Khulna-based, Bengali-language daily Anirban,
died shortly before midnight on April 21, while undergoing treatment at
Khulna Medical College Hospital for injuries sustained in an attack
days earlier. Late on the night of April 17, masked men kidnapped Ali
from his home in the village of Shovna, according to local press
reports. The assailants stabbed him, beat him severely, and broke his
hands and legs before abandoning him on the outskirts of his village,
according to police.
Ali was found unconscious and taken to the hospital in Khulna, a major
city in southwestern Bangladesh. Doctors said he died due to major
brain damage and profuse bleeding.
Police suggested that members of the outlawed Biplobi Communist Party
may have killed Ali because of a dispute over ownership of a shrimp
farm. However, journalists in Khulna said that the investigation lacked
credibility because Ali’s reporting had uncovered links between police
and smuggling rings in the region. CPJ sources said that Ali, who
worked as the Dumuria subdistrict correspondent for Anirban,
was killed because “he knew too much” about the workings of local
criminal syndicates and the complicity of some local authorities in
their activities.

135,Narendra Dabholkar,Sadhana,"August 20, 2013",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Two unidentified gunmen on motorcycles shot Narendra Dabholkar in the city of Pune while he was taking an early-morning walk, according to local reports. The gunmen fled the scene. Dabholkar died from injuries sustained to his neck and back, police said.
Dabholkar was the editor of a weekly Marathi-language print magazine called Sadhana (Spiritual Devotion), which promotes scientific thought and covers topics including caste, politics, and religion. Over the years, Dabholkar had angered many Indians with his lectures and writings, which propagated rationalism and scientific thinking in a country where superstitious beliefs are still rampant, the reports said.
Dabholkar, a prominent campaigner against religious superstition, had also spent several years writing in support of legislation to ban fraudulent and exploitative superstitious practices. A few days before his murder, the Maharashtra state government said it would introduce a controversial anti-superstition bill, according to reports.
Dabholkar had received threats in the days before his murder, his son, Hamid, told NDTV. Sadhana often published articles on sensitive issues, including the creation of a separate Telangana state, student suicides, farmer suicides, slums, and the ideology behind India’s Naxalite movement.
Dabholkar had also founded the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (Committee for Eradication of Blind Faith), a group that encouraged social reform in India.
Maharashtra Home Minister R. R. Patil said on August 23, 2013, that police were investigating the murder.

Also in August 2013, Pune police arrested two alleged arms dealers, Manish Nagori and Vilas Khandelwal, on charges of extortion, reports said. The pair, who were later named as suspects in the journalist’s murder, were released on bail because of a lack of evidence, police said, according to reports. Because the men face charges in other cases, they remain in jail. Both have denied any role in the murder, and Nagori said that investigating authorities offered him money to accept involvement in the murder, reports said. Authorities denied the allegation.

In May 2014 the Maharashtra state government handed the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Investigations were delayed for a year because of staff shortages at the agency, according to reports. In July and August 2015, the bureau wrote to the state government to request that more officers be assigned to the case, The Hindu reported.

In July 2015, relatives of Dabholkar filed a writ petition at the Bombay High Court seeking court monitoring of the investigation, according to reports. In December 2015, the Central Bureau of Investigation informed the Bombay High Court that it had identified two suspects and handed the names to the court, reports said. The names were kept confidential, The Hindu reported.

In 2016, the bureau questioned several members of the hard-line Hindu group Sanatan Sanstha, which is believed to be behind the killing. The Sanatan Sanstha denies any role in the murder, reports said. Forensic analysis of the bullet cartridges found at the scene of Dabholkar’s killing and that of writers Govind Pansare and MM Kalburgi suggest a common set of killers, reports said.

Afridi, a reporter for Pakistan Television and the local
Mashriq newspaper, was killed when his car blew up in the city of Peshawar,
according to local and international news reports. An explosive device was
detonated remotely shortly after he returned to the vehicle, which was parked
in a densely populated shopping area, news reports said.
The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists said Afridi, who
was also the president of the Tribal Union of Journalists, had moved to
Peshawar to flee militant groups. 
In May 2006, CPJ reported, unidentified assailants had
lobbed two hand grenades at Afridi’s house in Bara, the main town of Khyber
Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Afridi had been the target
of a death threat issued on a pirate radio station run by the Islamic militant
organization Lashkar-e-Islam. The threat came after Afridi reported that the
authorities suspected Lashkar-e-Islam of being responsible for an attack in
which a paramilitary soldier was injured.
The journalist moved to Islamabad after the attack but said
officials there would not heed his complaints of being under threat. He then
moved to the wealthy Hayatabad area of Peshawar. But in mid-2007, grenades were
lobbed at his home there. No one was injured in that attack.
Afridi was a popular, senior figure in the tightly knit
journalist community in the dangerous areas along the Afghan border. Hundreds
of people, including colleagues, political leaders, and tribal elders, attended
his memorial service. No arrests were made in the case.

Sharma, editor of the Nepali-language weekly Kadam, was kidnapped by Maoist rebels on June 1 and later killed, according to a team of journalists and human rights activists organized by the government’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The NHRC visited Kalikot District, where Sharma lived, as part of an August mission to Nepal’s remote midwestern region. The group learned of his murder from local residents and police.
 Nepal’s Maoist rebels, who have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1996 to overthrow the country’s constitutional monarchy, control portions of the country, including much of Kalikot and neighboring districts.
 Maoist fighters kidnapped Sharma from the Kalikot District village of Syuna on June 1, according to members of the NHRC team. The national English-language newspaper The Kathmandu Post reported that police recovered Sharma’s badly mutilated body from the area in mid-August. Rebels had gouged out his eyes, cut his hands and legs, and shot him in the chest, police told the NHRC team.
 Sharma, who lived in the village of Sipkhana, which is adjacent to Syuna, was known as an independent journalist. He had been working at Kadam since 1998 and was formerly the editor of the local newspaper Karnali Sandesh, according to the Kathmandu-based Center for Human Rights and Democratic Studies (CEHURDES). A CEHURDES representative was part of the NHRC team that visited the area.
 Sharma was also a local schoolteacher, but local press sources said it appeared that he was targeted for his journalism. One journalist said that Sharma had refused pressure from the rebels to turn Kadam into a Maoist propaganda organ.

According to Kumar, the Arrah village head, Mohammad Harshu, was driving the car that ran over Nischal and Singh. Police have arrested both Harshu and his son, Dablu, who was in the vehicle with his father at the time of the accident, Kumar said.
CPJ was unable to locate contact information for Mohammad and Dablu Harshus’ lawyers to get comment.
The Indian Express, quoting police sources, said that an argument had broken out between Nischal, Vijay Singh, and Mohammad Harshu earlier in the day.

At least four assailants entered the blogger’s home and hacked him to death with sharp weapons in the Goran neighborhood in the capital, Dhaka, according to news reports.
The blogger was popularly known by his penname, Niloy Neel. His last name was identified in news reports as Chatterjee and Chattopadhyay.
Neel frequently criticized Islamic extremism and advocated for minority rights, as well as secular ideas, according to news reports. He was a regular contributor to Mukto-Mona, the blog founded by Bangladeshi-American blogger Avijit Roy, who was murdered in February 2015 while visiting Dhaka, The Wall Street Journal reported. Neel also contributed to Istishon, a blog on social and political issues, according to Global Voices, and posted commentaries on Facebook.
Neel was also an active member of the Ganajagaran Mancha, a group campaigning for the execution of those accused of committing war crimes during Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence.
In 2013, Neel’s name appeared on a list widely circulated by Islamist groups in Bangladesh that called for the deaths of 84 bloggers perceived to be atheists, according to news accounts.
The BBC reported that Neel identified as a secular atheist and came from a Hindu background–similar to bloggers Roy and Ananta Bijoy Das, slain earlier in 2015.
Neel was the fourth blogger to be killed in Bangladesh in six months. Another secular blogger, Washiqur Rahman Babu, died on March 30 from injuries he sustained in an attack in broad daylight.
Hours after Neel was killed, an Islamist group claimed responsibility for his death, according to news accounts.
Neel’s wife, Asha Moni, said that a few months prior to his death, police at a nearby police station refused to accept a complaint Neel tried to file after he noticed he was being followed by strange men, according to reports, which also cited a review of Neel’s Facebook posts. Police said they were unaware of any such request.
The blogger’s friends said he had been threatened in the past, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), according to Sunanda Deshapriya,
spokesman for local press freedom group the Free Media Movement. 
Deshapriya said that FMM’s investigations had shown that Devakumar was killed

Sultan, editor of the independent newswire service News and Feature

Jammu and Kashmir State, was shot dead by an unidentified gunman.
Two men entered Sultan’s office at around 5:30 p.m., according to news

him in the head. The Associated Press (AP) reported that the killer
used a pistol with a silencer. No one stopped the assailants from
leaving the premises, which is located in the press enclave in central
Srinagar.
Though Sultan was rushed to the hospital, doctors declared the
journalist dead within minutes of his arrival, police told the AP.
Sultan, 36, was known as an independent journalist who had worked for
several local Urdu-language dailies during his career. In addition to
running NAFA, he contributed investigative stories and columns to the
Urdu-language newspaper Chattan, one of the oldest newspapers in Kashmir.
Journalists working in the disputed territory of Kashmir, which both
India and Pakistan claim, have long been vulnerable to attack by
various parties to the conflict. Sultan’s colleagues told CPJ that

Bhatia, a photographer for the Indian newspaper The Hindustan Times, was one of at least 12 people killed in a bomb attack in the Kashmir capital, Srinagar. Six other journalists died in the blast.
 The militant Kashmiri separatist group Hezb-ul Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement issued from its headquarters in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.
 Hezb-ul Mujahedeen spokesman Salim Hashmi was quoted in the August 11 edition of The Hindustan Times as saying, “We are deeply grieved over the death of a press photographer and injuries to some journalists.” He said the attack had targeted Indian security forces.
 However, the choreography of the bombing seemed certain to endanger journalists.
 Shortly after noon on Thursday, August 10, a grenade was thrown toward the entrance of the State Bank of India, near Residency Road in central Srinagar. This initial blast lured journalists and security forces to the area and was followed about 15 minutes later by the detonation of a powerful car bomb within a few feet of the crowd.
 Bhatia, 31, died of shrapnel wounds to his heart, according to the Indian newspaper The Asian Age. Including Bhatia, nine journalists have been killed in Kashmir since 1989, when a long-running conflict between Muslim separatists and Indian government forces became a full-scale civil war.

Goala was murdered near his home in Golaghat district in India’s northeastern state of Assam after writing a series of articles on corruption in the Assamese-language daily Asomiya Khabar that linked local forestry service officials to timber smuggling.
 Local journalists told CPJ that police arrested forest warden Zamman Jinnah in connection with the death. He was released on bail. Two other suspects, who were not forestry service employees, were also taken into custody, the journalists said.
 Jinnah had made death threats against Goala soon after his articles on corruption in the forestry service appeared, The Assam Tribune reported.
 Goala, 32, was riding a motorcycle near his home some 160 miles (260 kilometers) east of the state capital, Guwahati, when he was apparently rammed by a truck. When police arrived at the scene, they found that Goala had been stabbed several times.
 Local journalist organizations and civic groups staged a protest in Golaghat on January 10 and called for a full investigation into the killing.
After Goala’s widow filed a First Information Report, police arrested an officer in the Forest Department named K. Zaman Jinnah, reports said. Police said the forest officer was suspected of hiring professional killers to murder Goala . Golaghat Superintendent of Police Madan Chetia said they were investigating, according to a 2006 report published in The Hoot. CPJ was unable to determine if the officer denied the charges against him.

Jinnah allegedly threatened Prahlad for his exposé on Jinnah’s alleged misuse of power, according to Rohit Gogoi, the general secretary of Golaghat District Journalists Association, The Hoot reported.

148,Prakash Singh Thakuri,Freelance,July 2007,Nepal,Killed,Murder,,"
Armed men believed to be associated with Nepal’s Maoist
party abducted freelance reporter Thakuri from his home in Mahendranagar, a city in Kanchanpur district, at around
10 a.m., on July 5, 2007. The journalist’s body was not recovered, but local
police later classified the investigation as a murder case. 
Thakuri edited and published the royalist newspaper Aajako Samachar until the king was
forced to cede control of the government in April 2006 after weeks of
pro-democracy demonstrations. He was also a prominent member of the royalist
National Journalists Federation, local newspapers reported.
Three days after Thakuri was abducted, a previously unknown group
calling itself the National Republican Army Nepal claimed in an email that it
had killed the journalist for circulating “propaganda in support of the
monarchy,” according to news reports. Police were unable to verify the origin
of the email, which lacked details such as the time and place of the murder, news
reports said. CPJ classified the case as missing until March 2012, after it conducted a fact-finding mission to Nepal.
Thakuri’s wife, Janaki, identified three members of the
Maoist’s notoriously aggressive youth branch, the Young Communist League, as being
part of the group responsible the kidnapping, news reports said.
The Maoist party signed a peace agreement in November 2006.
After it joined the coalition government as the Unified Communist Party of
Nepal (Maoist), leaders stopped the investigation of the three men in
2009, arguing that the 2006 peace accord precluded prosecution for political
crimes, according to the local press freedom group Freedom Forum. In 2011,
Nepal’s Supreme Court reinstated the case, ruling that the accord applied only to
crimes committed before November 2006. The murder case remains open in a
Kanchanpur court.

149,Puniyamoorthy Sathiyamoorthy,freelance,"February 12, 2009",Sri Lanka,Killed,Dangerous Assignment,,"

Sathiyamoorthy, a supporter of the secessionist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), wrote for many pro-Tamil publications and
frequently contributed to official LTTE media. His live commentaries from
conflict zones were widely seen and heard on pro-Tamil television and radio
broadcasts. According to independent Tamil news sources as well as the LTTE, he
was killed in a Sri Lankan artillery barrage in the Mullaitheevu district.
Colleagues outside of the conflict area, not all of them
Tamils, said Sathiyamoorthy’s reports and commentaries were measured, and that
he strove to maintain journalistic standards and an accurate representation of
the wartime situations in which he found himself. His work had global impact, reaching large
numbers of Tamils living overseas.
Born in 1972, he eventually moved to Jaffna but traveled throughout the areas
controlled by the LTTE during the conflict. He was married and was the father
of a 6-year-old girl.
Several Tamil media reports said Sathiyamoorthy did not die
immediately. They cited relatives who said a lack of proper medical
attention contributed to his death.

150,Rajdev Ranjan,Hindustan,"May 13, 2016",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Unknown men shot Rajdev Ranjan, the Hindi national daily newspaper Hindustan‘s bureau chief for Siwan, in the central Indian state of Bihar, at close range as he was returning to his office, according to press reports. The journalist, also identified as Rajdeo Ranjan in press reports, was hit in the head and the chest, killing him, according to local media. Police said they were investigating the killing, and said Ranjan had no known personal enmity with anyone, according to reports. 
In June, police said they had arrested five suspects in the shooting, who named Laddan Mian as the man who hired them to commit the murder, reports said. Mian, whom news reports identified as having political connections, voluntarily appeared before a court on June 2, 2016, and denied involvement in the killing, news reports said. 
The journalist’s widow, Asha Devi, believes Ranjan was killed in retribution for his critical reporting on a lawmaker who is currently serving prison time for dozens of charges, including murder, illegal possession of firearms, and voter-intimidation, according to news reports. In March 2016, Ranjan had broken news about a prison meeting between the former lawmaker and another local official, who shared a “feast,” reports said. Local journalists said Ranjan had been receiving death threats from criminals before his death, news accounts said.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s state government called for a probe into the killing by the national-level investigative agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, according to reports.

151,Rajesh Mishra,Media Raj,"March 1, 2012",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Two assailants hit Mishra on the head with an iron rod while he was at a public tea stall in Rewa town in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, according to local news reports. The journalist died at a local hospital, the reports said.
Mishra, a journalist for the local Hindi-language weekly Media Raj, had written articles on alleged financial irregularities in local schools, according to the news reports. The reports cited the journalist’s family members as saying that he had been threatened during the week leading up to the attack.

Police arrested at least four men for carrying out the murder, including Rajneesh Banerjee, who owned the schools Mishra was covering and a rival Hindi-language weekly, Vindhya Bharat. Vindhya Bharat Editor Anil Tripathi and two other employees were also arrested.
Rewa Superintendent of Police Umesh Joga told the New Delhi-based media watchdog website The Hoot that Banerjee and his associates had retaliated against Mishra in connection with his reports. Vindhya Bharat and Media Raj each had a circulation of about 500 copies, The Hoot reported.
Banerjee was convicted of murder by a court in Rewa and sentenced to life imprisonment under section 120B of the Indian Penal Code, according to Banerjee. At an appeal hearing in January 2015, the Madhya Pradesh High Court granted bail to Banerjee. In its decision, the court said that the main evidence against him was two letters written by Mishra, in which the journalist said he feared Banerjee would kill him. The judges said this was insufficient evidence, adding, “Merely because certain apprehension is made, it cannot be a material for assuming that the appellant has convicted the offence.”
In April 2016, Banerjee told CPJ that his conviction was suspended and he had been granted bail. “I was in my office at that time [when Mishra was killed], yet I was convicted,” he said. His co-accused, Tripathi, was acquitted, he said. Banerjee said he was confident he would also be acquitted because a doctor’s report allegedly said that Mishra was drunk at the time. CPJ was unable to verify his claims.

153,Rajesh Verma,IBN 7,"September 7, 2013",India,Killed,Dangerous Assignment,,"
Unidentified assailants fatally shot Rajesh Verma, a part-time stringer for the TV news channel IBN 7, in the chest while he was covering confrontations between Hindus and Muslims in the small city of Muzaffarnagar, according to Ajesh Mohan, senior assistant editor at IBN 7, and local news reports.
Mohan told CPJ that Verma had worked for the station for about five years. Poh Si Teng, a former freelance journalist for Global Post, told CPJ that in the past Verma had also worked as a fixer for the Global Post.
Indian officials said at the time that they had not been able to identify the perpetrator and that they were investigating the fatality.
The clashes erupted following police dispersal of a meeting by Hindu farmers calling for justice in the killings of two Hindu men, according to The New York Times. The victims were believed to have been killed by Muslims, news reports said. Officials said the clashes were also fueled by a false video circulated last week that purportedly showed the two men being lynched. At least 28 people were killed and more than 90 individuals arrested in the violence.
Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh met with Verma’s family and told them the culprits would be held responsible. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav announced financial support of Rs. 1,500,000 (US $23,870) for Verma’s family.
In February 2016, a Special Investigation Team set up to look at cases related to the Muzaffarnagar riots filed a closure report in Verma’s case. The report, which was filed in the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Narendra Kumar, said that the accused remain unidentified.

Sharma a senior reporter for a Hindi-language daily Aaj (Today), specialized in crime reporting in the region, according to reports.
Police said they were investigating the attack. Investigators said the killing may have been prompted by “personal enmity,” but did not offer further details, according to The Hoot, a South Asian media watchdog.
Local journalists dismissed the claim, saying police had not substantiated their theory or offered any evidence to back it up, and said they believed Sharma had been targeted by a local gambling mafia for a critical report he had published on illegal gambling operations.
Sharat Pradhan, senior journalist and Uttar Pradesh Accredited Journalists Association member, told The Hoot that under the ruling Samajwadi Party there had been a rise in mafia and criminal activity in the state, and suggested that Sharma may have been targeted for his critical reporting against local politicians.
Rakesh Tiwari, president of the association, told The Hoot that he believed Sharma was targeted for his work.
Sharma was killed in the home district of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. Local journalists criticized the minister for what they perceive as a lack of security for journalists working in the minister’s own district.
In the weeks surrounding Sharma’s murder, journalists reported several cases of their colleagues, who covered politics, business, and corruption, being beaten or threatened by local politicians and criminals, according to The Wall Street Journal.

155,Rakesh Singh,Rashtriya Swaroop,"November 28, 2020",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Rakesh Singh, a journalist with local Hindi newspaper Rashtriya Swaroop, died from burn injuries on November 28, 2020, after his house was set on fire in the Balrampur district of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh the previous day, according to news reports. 
On November 30, Uttar Pradesh police identified and arrested three suspects in connection to the alleged arson, one of them the son of a local village head, but had not filed charges in the case as of early December, reports said.
In a press conference on November 30, Balrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma said that the son of the village head was allegedly motivated to kill the journalist because of his critical reporting on the village head ahead in a local election. 
Local news reports quoted Verma saying that the son of the village head, Singh, and Pintu Sahu, the journalist’s friend, were drinking alcohol at Singh’s home on the day of the attack. During that meeting, the son of the village head tried to convince Singh to stop writing negative reports about his mother, Verma told Indian Express.
According to reports, the journalist and Sahu fell asleep, and the son of the village head called two individuals, one a pyrotechnic expert, to allegedly help him set the home on fire using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. 
Siddharth Kalhans, secretary of the Indian Federation of Working Journalists, told CPJ via phone that the alleged assailants locked the door of the room from the outside as Singh and Sahu tried to escape. According to broadcaster NDTV, Sahu died on the way to a local hospital, while Singh was rushed to a hospital in Lucknow, west of Balrampur, where he later died. 
Kalhans said he believes that the attack was retaliation for the journalist’s reporting on the village head’s family, though did not point to a specific article. 
According to Newslaundry and Kalhans, Singh had informed the local authorities about a possible threat to his life over his reporting, but the police did not take action. 
According to Indian Express, one of two alleged assailants who helped the village head’s son had an “old enmity” with the journalist, which escalated into an argument last year that was resolved by local police. The report did not provide further details on the incident. 
CPJ emailed the Balrampur police for comment but did not receive a response.

Chaterpatti, editor of the Hindi-language newspaper Poora Sach, died in a New Delhi hospital of injuries sustained in an assassination attempt made a month earlier.
 On October 24, a gunman fired several shots at Chaterpatti, a journalist based in Sirsa, a town in the northern state of Haryana. Chaterpatti was taken to an area hospital but was later transferred to the Apollo Hospital in New Delhi.
 Police arrested three suspects, including the alleged gunman and a leader of the Sirsa-based religious sect Dera Sacha Sauda, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. Officials said that Dera Sacha Sauda members are believed to have ordered Chaterpatti’s murder in reprisal for the journalist’s reporting on sexual abuse and other crimes allegedly committed at the group’s compound in Sirsa.
 A delegation of journalists, including the president of the regional journalists’ group Haryana Patrakar Sangh and representatives of India’s National Union of Journalists, met with the director general of police in Haryana on the day of Chatterpatti’s death, November 21, to press authorities to bring the journalist’s killers to justice. The delegation also complained that several journalists in the area have received death threats for reporting on the activities of Dera Sacha Sauda.
On January 17, 2019, a special court in Haryana convicted Gurmeet Ram Rahim, Kuldeep Singh, Nirmal Singh, and Krishan Lal of Chaterpatti’s murder and of criminal conspiracy. The court sentenced them each to life imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 rupees (US$700).

Mohamed, a provincial correspondent for Sirasa TV, was
covering the opening ceremony of the new office of the United National Party

when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device. 
The blast apparently came from a member of the Liberation

opposition UNP. The target appeared to be retired Maj. Gen. Janaka Perera, who
died in the blast. At least 27 people died, and at least 80 more were wounded in
the explosion.
Security was apparently lax at the event. UNP officials
quoted by The Associated Press accused the government of ignoring repeated
requests for a stronger security detail for Perera, who was a vocal critic of
the way the government had conducted its military campaign against the LTTE
secessionists. “The government must take full responsibility. They did not give
him adequate security for political reasons,” AP quoted party official

Popular Tamil broadcaster Relangi Selvarajah and her husband, a
political activist, were killed by unidentified gunmen in Colombo on
the same day that Lakshman Kadirgamar, Sri Lanka’s foreign minister,
was assassinated. Political leaders blamed the rebel Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for all three killings, charges the LTTE denied.
			  The attackers shot Selvarajah, 44, and her husband, Senathurai, in the office where they ran a travel agency. Sri Lanka’s Sunday Times reported that the LTTE had criticized Selvarajah for broadcasting anti-LTTE programs.
Selvarajah was a radio and television host for 20 years, presenting
news programs for the state-run Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation
(SLBC) and more recently for the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corp., according
to the Free Media Movement, a local press freedom organization.
Local newspapers reported that Selvarajah also produced the SLBC
program “Ithaya Veenai,” a program known for criticizing the LTTE, and
allegedly funded by the opposition Tamil political party, the Eelam
People’s Democratic Party.
Selvarajah’s husband was affiliated with the formerly militant and now
mainstream group, the People’s Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam
(PLOTE), according to local news reports and sources. PLOTE is critical
of the LTTE; the LTTE accuses PLOTE of attacking its members, according
to The Associated Press.
			  Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror quoted
police as saying that they suspected the couple may have been murdered
because of Selvarajah’s anti-LTTE programs. But their connection to
PLOTE also raised the possibility that their killing may have been part
of a larger cycle of violence and could be connected to the April
murder of well-known pro-LTTE Tamil journalist Dharmeratnam Sivaram,
local sources told CPJ. Sivaram was a former member of PLOTE who
defected to the LTTE.
 Political and ethnic factions
began a series of revenge killings across the country last year when a
Tamil rebel leader known as Colonel Karuna split from the LTTE.
The government declared a state of emergency on August 13 and President
Chandrika Kumaratunga accused the LTTE of killing Kadirgamar, a critic
of the LTTE.

Assailants beat and stabbed Reddy, 51, reporter for the Hindi-language newspaper Deshbandhu, as he left a market in Basaguda village in Bijapur district located in the central state of Chhattisgarh, news reports said. He sustained severe head and neck injuries, and died as he was being transported to a local hospital, reports said.
Reddy possessed a deep understanding of local issues and problems, and was considered a veteran journalist by his colleagues, news accounts said. He covered local issues such as health, education, water supply, food distribution, and corruption, and often criticized the government, Maoist insurgents, security forces, and local police, The Hindu said, citing journalists who knew him.
Police said they believed Reddy was attacked by a group of Maoist insurgents with sharp weapons, news accounts reported. In the days following Reddy’s murder, Maoists claimed responsibility, according to news reports. In their statement, the Maoists accused Reddy of being a police informer, but did not substantiate their claims.
In recent years, Reddy had been threatened by Maoists and his house was set on fire, which forced him to flee to a neighboring state, according to The Times of India. He was allowed to return home after issuing an apology to the Maoists, the report said. Reddy had also been harassed by the police around the same time, according to news reports. In March 2008, he was arrested and accused of being linked to the Maoists. He denied the allegations and was later released on bail.
Four months after the murder, the highest decision-making body of the Maoist party released a statement about the killing. In an April 2014 press statement, the body said there was a “misunderstanding” between members and the party leadership, which led to the killing. The statement by the party said that a decision was taken to kill Sai Reddy for his “anti-people” writing. When police arrested Reddy in 2008 on suspicion of being a Maoist, the party changed its perception of him. This was not conveyed to local members, who killed him, the statement said. No one has been brought to justice in the case. 
Journalists in Chhattisgarh are often caught in the tension between Maoists and police and security forces, CPJ research shows. Maoists have led an insurgency in the central tribal areas of India for more than four decades.

Province, which is now known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Tanoli was stopped on a
highway, dragged from his car, and shot several times, the official Associated
Press of Pakistan reported. 
Tanoli had written critical stories about the head of the
local government, Khalid Javed, including a piece published three days before
his murder that accused the official of involvement in an illegal liquor
business, news reports said. Police filed murder charges against Javed,
prompting the official to flee, according to news reports. Although Javed
eventually returned, the murder charges were never revived, according to Kiran
Nazish, a journalist who has studied anti-press attacks in Pakistan.

170,Saleem Shahzad,Asia Times Online,"May 29 or 30, 2011",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"

Shahzad, 40, vanished on May 29 after writing about alleged
links between Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani Navy. His body was found on May 31 in
a canal near the town of Mandi Bahauddin, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south
of the capital, Islamabad. His friends said the body showed signs of torture
around the face and neck. He had told colleagues that he had been receiving
threats from intelligence officials in recent months.
Shahzad was reported missing after he failed to show up for
a televised panel discussion in Islamabad. He was scheduled to discuss his
recent article for Asia Times Online in which he reported that Al-Qaeda, having
infiltrated the Pakistani Navy, was behind a 17-hour siege at a naval base in
Karachi on May 22. He said the attack came after military or security officials
refused to release a group of naval officials suspected of being linked to
militant groups. The attack, coming soon after the U.S. killing of Osama bin
Laden on May 2, was deeply embarrassing to the Pakistani military. Earlier in
May, three navy buses carrying recruits were blown up via remote control
devices in Karachi, the large port city where the navy has its headquarters. 
Shahzad’s death also came a few days after the release of
his book, Inside the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. 
For months, the journalist had been telling friends that he
had been warned by intelligence agents to stop reporting on sensitive security
matters. In October 2010, Shahzad told Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher for Human
Rights Watch in Pakistan, that he had been threatened by a top official at a
meeting at the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate in
Rawalpindi. 
Hasan said Shahzad sent him a note describing the meeting
“in case something happens to me or my family in the future,” Human Rights
Watch reported. Hameed Haroon, president of the All Pakistan Newspapers Society
and a former employer of Shahzad, said he had received a similar message at
about the same time. 
In July 2011, The New York Times reported that U.S.
officials had reliable intelligence that showed that the ISI was responsible
for Shahzad’s murder. Pakistan’s official commission of inquiry concluded in
January 2012 that the perpetrators were unknown, a finding that was widely
criticized as lacking credibility.

171,Sandeep Sharma,News World,"March 26, 2018",India,Killed,Murder,,"
Sandeep Sharma, a reporter for the local News World television channel in Madhya Pradesh state’s Bhind district, was killed on March 26, 2018. He was driving on his motorbike to a government event when a truck veered into him and ran him over, according to the channel’s bureau chief, Vikas Purohit, who witnessed the collision, and a report by NDTV. Purohit told CPJ that he took Sharma to the local hospital where the journalist was declared dead from injuries sustained in the crash.
Purohit said both he and Sharma began receiving death threats last year after publishing two stories in July and October 2017 on alleged police corruption and illegal sand mining. The journalists shot a video that showed how a senior police officer accepted a bribe to allow the movement of vehicles carrying illegally mined sand, according to a report in the Indian Express newspaper. With strong demand for construction in India, illegal sand mining has increasingly become a problem because sand is difficult to transport and ""regulatory consequences are minimal"" for extracting it from off-limits areas, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.
Purohit said local residents came to him and Sharma and said they would “crush them under a truck” for doing the stories. The villagers would also pass by the house when the journalists were home to intimidate them, Purohit said.
Prashant Khare, the Bhind police superintendent, told CPJ that police were examining CCTV footage and that they had arrested the truck driver who hit Sharma. “A special investigation team has been formed to investigate whether this was an accident or it was a murder,” Khare said. 
Purohit told CPJ that about 10 days after News World aired Sharma’s October investigation, the journalist was ""beaten up by a bunch of goons but was saved thanks to the presence of police."" He said the thugs they didn’t specifically mention the report. According to Purohit, Sharma filed a formal complaint to the police about the beating, but they did not take further action. 
The News World bureau chief also said that he and Sharma wrote letters to government authorities, including the state’s inspector general of police, to ask for government protection after they began receiving death threats, but they received no response.
Khare confirmed that police received letters from Purohit and Sharma in December complaining about the threats. He said he had no knowledge of Sharma being beaten up.
""[T]he deputy superintendent of police conducted an inquiry and found that there was no threat to their lives,"" Khare told CPJ.
Shivraj Singh Chouhan, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state, recommended an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), according to government officials who were quoted by the Hindustan Times newspaper. 
CBI spokesperson RK Gaur told CPJ that the agency has not received instructions from the federal government to investigate the case.

172,Saqib Khan,Ummat,"November 22, 2012",Pakistan,Killed,Dangerous Assignment,,"
Khan, a photographer for the Urdu-language paper Ummat, died
from injuries he sustained in a bomb explosion that occurred 30 minutes after
another blast outside a Shia site in Karachi, according to the International
Federation of Journalists and the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists. Khan
was killed while covering the first explosion, the same sources said.
Police said the first blast was a suicide attack, while the
second bomb was detonated with a remote-controlled device. The second bomb
exploded about 50 feet from the first one, wounding reporters, police officers,
and bomb disposal teams who had arrived at the scene. 
The bombs exploded at a site frequently used for Shia
commemoration ceremonies; Shias were celebrating the holy month of Muharram,
the first month of the Islamic calendar. 
No group claimed responsibility for the twin bombings, but
two days after the explosions, Taliban spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan called Agence
France-Presse and said the Taliban had dispatched more than 20 suicide bombers
to target Shia Muslims.

173,Selvarajah Rajeewarnam,Uthayan,"April 29, 2007",Sri Lanka,Killed,Murder,,"
Rajeewarnam, a reporter for the Tamil-language daily Uthayan, was aboard a bicycle on assignment in Jaffna when he was shot by unidentified motorcycle-riding gunmen about 600 feet (180 meters) from a military checkpoint, according to Uthayan staffers.
Rajeewarnam, a Tamil, had worked for another Tamil paper, Namadu Eelanadu, which closed soon after its managing editor, Sinnathamby Sivamaharajah, was killed outside his home in Jaffna in August 2006. Rajeewarnam had worked at Uthayan for about four months.
Uthayan has often been under attack. In September 2006, CPJ called on Sri Lankan authorities to fulfill their duty to protect Uthayan‘s staff after receiving a telephone plea from E. Saravanapavan, the paper’s managing director, to publicize the numerous threats against his staff.

174,Shafiullah Khan,The News,"June 17, 2011",Pakistan,Killed,Dangerous Assignment,,"

Asfandyar Khan, a reporter for the newspaper
Akhbar-e-Khyber, died in a double bombing that took the lives of more than
three dozen people. Shafiullah Khan, a trainee reporter at the daily The News,
died six days later from extensive burns and shrapnel wounds suffered in the
attack. Seven other journalists were injured.
The first, small blast went off at a market, drawing a large
crowd that included journalists covering the story, according to news reports
and local journalists. A second, larger explosion, apparently a suicide bomb,
went off after the crowd had grown.
The attack took place near the city center, in an area where
military facilities are concentrated and where many major Pakistani media
organizations have their offices. No group immediately claimed responsibility
for the bombings, and it was not clear if journalists or military personnel
were the targets.

175,Shahid Soomro,Kawish,"October 20, 2002",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
Soomro, a correspondent for the Sindhi-language newspaper Kawish, was assassinated in the town of Kandhkot, Sindh Province, apparently in reprisal for his reporting on abuses committed during general elections held on October 10.
 At around midnight on October 20, three men went to Soomro’s home and tried to abduct him, according to his younger brother Aziz, who witnessed the crime. When Soomro resisted, the men shot him dead. Kawish editor Ali Kazi said that Soomro had at least nine bullet wounds and died almost instantly.
 The gunmen escaped with two accomplices in a white car waiting outside Soomro’s house, said local news reports.
 Aziz filed a case with police identifying three of the assailants by name, Wahid Ali Bijarani, Mohammad Ali Bijarani, and Mohammad Siddiq.
 Wahid Ali and Mohammad Ali, who are brothers, are members of the powerful Bijarani family, which owns much land in the area around Kandhkot and exercises considerable influence through the feudal system still prevalent in much of Pakistan. A third brother, Mir Mehboob Bijarani, was elected to the Sindh Provincial Assembly in the October 10 poll, while an uncle, Mir Hazzar Khan Bijarani, won a seat in the National Assembly. (Both represent exiled former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party.)
 Soomro’s colleagues suspect that he was killed for his reporting about alleged abuses committed by Bijarani family members and supporters during the general elections. Soomro had a reputation for courageous, independent reporting, and his publication, Kawish, is one of the most influential newspapers in Sindh Province.
 On October 24, 2002, police announced that Wahid Ali Bijarani, Mohammad Ali Bijarani, and Mohammad Siddiq, the three suspects identified by the journalist’s family, had been detained for questioning. At year’s end, the three men remained in custody but had not been charged. The Bijarani family did not comment publicly on the allegations.

176,Shahid Zehri,Metro 1 News,"October 10, 2021",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
On October 10, 2021, Shahid Zehri, a reporter for the privately owned news channel Metro 1 News, was killed in an explosion while driving his car in the southern Pakistan city of Hub, in the Lasbela district of Baluchistan province, according to multiple news reports citing local police officials, and a report by his employer. 
The Baloch Liberation Army, an ethnic separatist group, took responsibility for the attack in a press release posted to social media, accusing Zehri of working with the intelligence branch of Pakistan’s military and “committing various crimes using the noble profession of journalism” with the support of the Frontier Corps, a government paramilitary force that operates in Baluchistan province.
Zehri, 35, died shortly after he was transferred to a hospital in the southern city of Karachi, according to those news reports, which said that his companion was also injured in the attack. Police opened an investigation into the killing, according to those reports.
A local police official told Al-Jazeera that the explosion appeared to have been caused by a magnetic device attached underneath Zehri’s driver’s seat; however, Dawn reported that security footage showed that the car was hit by a roadside bomb. Both reports state that the killing appeared to be a targeted attack.
A representative of Metro 1 News told CPJ in a phone interview that Zehri covered general news and politics in Baluchistan province and did not engage in investigative reporting. The representative said that he did not know of a particular report by Zehri that could have led to the attack.
CPJ emailed Tariq Ilahi, senior superintendent of the Lasbela district police, for comment, but did not receive any reply.

177,Shamsur Rahman,Janakantha,"July 16, 2000",Bangladesh,Killed,Murder,,"
Rahman, a special correspondent for the Bengali-language national daily Janakantha and a frequent contributor to the BBC’s Bengali-language service, was killed at around 8:20 p.m. when two armed men entered his office and fired at his head and chest from point-blank range. The 43-year-old journalist was working alone in his office on Jail Road in central Jessore when the assailants arrived. The gunmen reportedly fled the scene immediately.
 Rahman was pronounced dead on arrival at Jessore General Hospital.
 Jessore, which is close to the Indian border with southwestern Bangladesh, is a center for smuggling operations. Rahman regularly covered the activities of criminal gangs and armed political groups in the region. Sources at Janakantha told CPJ that he had periodically received death threats in response to his reporting.
 Police blamed Rahman’s murder on a smuggler’s gang based in nearby Khulna. A high-profile investigation led to a series of arrests, but all the suspects had been released by year’s end, according to CPJ sources.

178,Shan Dahar,Abb Takk Television,"January 1, 2014",Pakistan,Killed,Murder,,"
Dahar, a reporter for Abb Takk
Television, was shot in the back while filming outside a pharmacy near the
Badah Press Club in Larkana, according to his sister and brother-in-law who
spoke to CPJ. He died shortly after at a local hospital.
Initial media
reports suggested that Dahar was hit
by a stray bullet as weapons were being fired into the air during New Year
celebrations, but in the days that followed, journalists and local media
support groups suggested this was an intentional killing.
Dahar’s sister and brother-in-law
told CPJ that they had seen the video that Dahar was recording at the time he
was killed. The video shows medication Dahar bought at a pharmacy that had a
“not for resale” stamp on it, they said. The journalist was killed a few
minutes after that.
Shortly before his death, Dahar
had broadcast a story on drug sales. At the time he was killed, he was working
on a report about the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs in the area,
according to Nasir Baig Chughtai, the director of news for Abb Takk. According
to Dahar’s family, medications allocated by a local NGO for the poor were being
resold illegally. Chughtai told CPJ that Dahar had
covered a range of stories on sensitive local issues, including politics and
poverty, and had been killed in retaliation for his work.
Dahar’s family as well as several local journalists expressed dismay at what they felt was
negligence on the part of the medical staff at the hospital that treated Dahar,
saying he would still be alive if he received timely and adequate medical care,
according to news reports.

Chughtai told CPJ that although
a suspect had been taken into custody, he believed the main culprits were still
at large. Local journalists have raised
concern about the way the investigation was carried out, according to news
reports. Despite a postmortem report being released, police have not
offered a conclusive motive in the journalist’s death.

Shantanu Bhowmik, a reporter for the local Bengali-language news channel Dinraat, was beaten to death on September 20, 2017, while he covered clashes between members of the separatist Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura and the ruling Tripura Rajya Upajati Ganamukti Parishad party in the northeastern Tripura state near the border with Bangladesh, according to media reports.
A mob used sticks to hit him on his head and legs, according to a report in the English-language Indian Express that quoted an unnamed journalist who was also covering the clashes.
According to the Indian Express, Bhowmik was taking pictures with his mobile phone when members of the crowd attacked him. Swapan Chakraborty, an editor at Dinraat, told CPJ that the last image the station received from Bhowmik was sent at 1:15 p.m.
Later that day, the police found Bhowmik’s body near a stadium, according to media reports.
Akhil Kumar Shukla, director general of Tripura state police said that three people were arrested and are being held in police custody on court order in relation to the journalist’s death, according to a September 28, 2017 report in The Times of India.
When CPJ spoke with Chakraborty in early December 2017, the editor said that four people were now in custody in relation to Bhowmik’s death. The editor described the suspects as belonging to or being supporters of the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura, and he said no charges had been filed.
